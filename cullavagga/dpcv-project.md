# Dutiya-Parakkamabāhu Cullavagga Transcription Project

- **Draft only!**

## Introduction

In the National Museum of Colombo there rests one of the oldest, and arguably most important, Pali manuscripts found anywhere in the world. It contains the Cullavagga, which consists of chapters 11–22 of the *Khandhaka* portion of the Pali Vinaya. The colophon in the manuscript indicates that it was copied during the reign of Parākramabāhu II, which would place it in the 13th century. Since almost all our current sources for Pali texts date from manuscripts of the 18th and 19th centuries, it is imperative that the Cullavagga text be digitally preserved and transcribed. In this project outline I set forth a proposal for how to accomplish this.

The aim of the project is to make available to scholars internationally the contents of this work for research. We propose a comprehensive approach to preparing a digital text. This will include the following items:

- Review the manuscript to ascertain the state of preservation.
- Scan the manuscript into high-resolution images.
- Engage an epigraphic expert to assess the script.
- Carbon date the manuscript.
- Have the manuscript carefully typed and proofread.
- Publish digitally and in print.
- Academic documentation
- Publicity and popular awareness

To accomplish this will require the cooperation and goodwill of scholars, governmental organizations, and universities.

## Some details and terminology

So far as I know, the manuscript in question has not become known by any accepted abbreviation. For reference purposes, and especially for handling digital resources, it is useful to agree on a clear and consistent abbreviation and referencing system.

### Naming the manuscript

Since the manuscript is said to have been sponsored by King Parākramabāhu II, it seems sensible to name it after him. The Pali term would be Dutiya-Parakkamabāhu. (See [Dīpavaṁsa II 37.84](http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/2_pali/3_chron/dipav_2u.htm) *dutiya-parakkamabhuja*.) Thus I propose the following:

- **The manuscript be named the “Dutiya-Parakkamabāhu Cullavagga”, with the acronym DP CV, or `dpcv` for programming contexts.**

<small>Note that, while the Sanskritic form *parākramabāhu* has become standard, in the Pali chronicles it appears as *parakkamabāhu* (or *parakkamabbāhu*). However, in texts such as the [Dīpamavamsa II](http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/2_pali/3_chron/dipav_2u.htm) and the [Mahāvaṁsa](http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/2_pali/3_chron/mahava_u.htm) the form *parakkamabhuja* is more common. *Bāhu* and *bhuja* are synonyms, both meaning “arm”. In the Mahāvaṁsa, for example, *parakkamabāhu* appears once only, while *parakkamabhuja* occurs 56 times. Until it is edited, of course, we cannot say what form is used in the manuscript itself. The Sanskritic drift of the king’s name is, aptly enough, an example of the kind of problem that we wish to address through studying this manuscript.</small>

### Naming the chapters

The Cullavagga is the second portion of the Khandhaka section of the Pali Vinaya. In the Khandhakas, it is preceded by the Mahāvagga, which consists of 10 chapters. The Cullavagga consists of 12 chapters; hopefully the manuscript contains all twelve, though this remains to be confirmed.

Thus we have:

- Pali Vinaya Khandhakas
  - Mahāvagga (10 chapters)
  - Cullavagga (12 chapters)

So for the numbering of chapters, I propose the following:

- **The chapters of the Cullavagga be named Kd 11–Kd 22, or `kd11`–`kd22` in programming contexts.**

This follows the conventions established on SuttaCentral, where Kd stands for Khandhaka, and the chapters are numbered as a simple increment.

<small>Note that the division between Mahāvagga and Cullavagga is not intrinsic to the texts, and does not correspond to any meaningful division of content. It is merely a division of convenience established for recitation and copying manuscripts. Other Vinayas in Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan lack this division and simply organize this portion of the texts as Khandhakas (Skt. *skandhaka*, sometimes also called *vastu*, etc.).</small>

## Background

The texts of the Pali Tipiṭaka are our most important witness for the original teachings and person of the Buddha. Their significance has always been recognized in Theravada Buddhism, and became known internationally in the 19th century through the work of scholars such as [T.W. Rhys Davids](http://0-www.worldcat.org.novacat.nova.edu/identities/lccn-n50035648/) in England and [Bunyiu Nanjio](http://0-www.worldcat.org.novacat.nova.edu/identities/lccn-n81033028/) in Japan.

Pali texts were traditionally passed down on palm (or *ola*) leaf manuscripts. From the late 19th century into the 20th century these manuscripts have been transcribed and published in book form. From the 1990s the books have been digitized, and are now widely available in several editions on the internet. All this has greatly increased the availability of the Pali texts and has benefited scholars immensely.

However, in recent years scholars have paid greater attention to the problem of manuscript authenticity. Almost all of the manuscripts in existence date from the 18th and 19th centuries. This means that the entire Pali tradition rests on physical witnesses no more than a couple of centuries old. Linguistic, historical, and other evidence gives us good reason to be confident that the Pali texts are, on the whole, much older than this, and that they substantially date back to the time of the Buddha or shortly after. (See *The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts*, Sujato and Brahmali.) Nevertheless, we should not neglect the opportunity to further test and refine our understanding of the historical provenance of the Pali texts.

A further problem is that almost all the Sri Lankan manuscripts stem from texts that were imported from Burma or Thailand around the 18th century. Thus, although Burma and Thailand originally received their texts from Sri Lanka, we have little evidence for a Sri Lankan transmission that has not passed through those countries. For a discussion of these and other issues regarding the state of Pali manuscripts in Sri Lanka, see Bhikkhu Ñāṇatusita, *Pali Manuscripts of Sri Lanka*. He observes that:

>Given the widespread neglect of collections, the general lack of interest in the preservation of and research into palm-leaf manuscripts in Sri Lanka, and often the considerable difficulty in getting access to collections, it is important that an international project is undertaken to preserve manuscripts by way of digitally photographing or scanning. This should be done in cooperation with Sri Lankan institutes such as the National Archives, universities, and a well-known international institute such as UNESCO, which already manages some important historical sites in Sri Lanka. The digital photographs should not be stored in just one institution, where they might be lost, as happened with the microfilms at the National Archives, but should be made freely available on the internet so that any scholar can access them. Also detailed information (description, history, photographs, list of manuscripts) should be given about the monasteries where the manuscripts were photographed.

While we are not prepared to undertake the more wide-scale digital preservation envisaged by Bhikkhu Ñāṇatusita, by preserving and published DP CV we can, perhaps, stimulate interest and further action to preserve manuscripts.

One of the few early Pali texts in existence was studied and published by Oskar von Hinuber in his *The Oldest Buddhist Manuscript*. This offers a transcription, description, and detailed study of a 8th–9th century Pali manuscript from Nepal by a leading Indological philologist. Von Hinuber suggests that it may have derived from a branch monastery of the Mahāvihāra on the mainland, possibly at Bodhgaya. As it happens, the text itself, while only a few pages, is from the Cullavagga. Thus it is a small portion of the same text found in the DP CV, and when the DP CV is published it will enable a study of the  same passage in manuscripts of the 8th, 13th, and 18th centuries.

When reading Pali texts in modern editions, it is quite evident that a process that might loosely be called “Sanskritization” has taken place, particularly in editions from Burma. We frequently see spelling variations even in common words, such as *supaṭipanna* vs. *suppaṭipanna*, *viriya* vs. *vīriya*, or *byākaraṇa* vs. *vyākaraṇa*. It is generally believed that this process occurred under the influence of medieval grammars such as the Saddanīti, which were based on the Sanskrit grammars. In most cases the spelling variants are inconsequential, and no more affect the meaning than, say, the choice to use UK or American spelling for English. Nevertheless, there are some cases where variant readings can affect the meaning of a passage. Thus it is important for scholars to study the nature of these changes, which can only be rigorously understood through studying early manuscripts or inscriptions.

## Who is involved

A project such as this requires a variety of specialized technical skills and equipment, and can only be accomplished through the cooperation of several parties. We will endeavor to work together with all parties who have an interest in the matter. Here is a preliminary note on relevant parties so far. Note that this is merely a record of initial meetings and does not imply that these people or organizations have made any commitment to the project.

1. **Sri Lankan Department of Archaeology**
   - The Department of Archaeology is the owner of the manuscript, and the governmental institution most directly concerned with preserving and making available Sri Lanka's ancient culture. We have had a preliminary meeting with Prasanna Ratnayake, the Acting Director General. He indicated that the Dept. would support this project, and may assist in various technical areas.
2. **National Museum of Colombo**
   - The manuscript has been housed here since 1901. We have had preliminary discussions with Mrs. Sanuja Kasthuriarachchi, the Acting Director of the Museum.
3. **Sri Lankan Ministry of Buddhasasana**
   - We have met with Prof. Nimal de Silva, adviser to the Minister, who greeted our project favorably.
4. **University of Sri Jayawardenepura**
   - Ven. Prof. Medagoda Abhayatissa has lent his support to the project in recognition of its importance for Pali studies.
5. **Bhante Sujato of SuttaCentral**
  - The author of this document! I have a special interest in the digital aspects of the project, due to my extensive experience managing digital texts for suttacentral.net.

## How to proceed

Here I will outline what I envisage as the scope of the project. This will have three aspects:

1. Divide the project into modules, each under the responsibility of a specific partner.
2. Describe a flow or process for completing each module.
3. Present a model for digital management of the project.

### Task modules

In order to achieve the project efficiently and in good time, it is important to break the project down into clear subtasks, each with an agreed body or person to take responsibility. Here is the initial proposal of this.

#### Review the manuscript to ascertain the state of preservation

The manuscript appears to be in good condition, but it must be carefully examined before taking any action. This must be done by an experienced expert in the field. Any recommendations must be followed so as to ensure the manuscript is not damaged by the digitization process.

   - **Responsible party:** Department of Archaeology together with National Museum.

#### Scan the manuscript into high-resolution images

The manuscript must be scanned carefully, using good quality modern equipment, and undertaken by qualified staff.

<small>There is, apparently, a microfilm of the manuscript, but this is not a good solution. Microfilm is an outdated technology, and it is difficult to find equipment to use it. In addition, it is unlikely that the microfilmed images are of quality comparable to that of modern scans.</small>

The images must be saved in as high resolution as practical. The basic image format must be lossless, which rules out `jpeg`. Ideally the base format would be `tiff`, but `png`, which uses lossless compression, is probably a better option, since the file sizes are much smaller.

The images must be saved using a sensible naming system. Since there is only one manuscript, I propose that we use a simple increment to number the pages, adding "r" and "v" for *recto* and *verso* as needed. Thus the images for the first leaf of the manuscript would be named `dpcv-1r` and `dpcv-1v` and so on. This might seem like a trivial detail, but maintaining a clear and consistent naming convention from the start can avoid a lot of headaches later on.

   - **Responsible party:** Department of Archaeology.

#### Engage an epigraphic expert to assess the script

The script appears to be an early version of the modern Sinhalese script. It is for the most part readily legible, and anyone familiar with modern Sinhalese should be able to read it. However, it is important that the exact nature of the script be defined as clearly as possible. To this end, an expert in Sri Lankan epigraphy should be engaged.

The examination should aim to provide an independent estimate of the date of the script. Even though we have no reason to doubt the date of the manuscript as given in the colophon, epigraphic evidence can provide important corroboration. After all, it is quite possible that a colophon written at an earlier date is simply copied by a different hand at a later date.

In addition to clarifying the date of the manuscript, epigraphic examination should ascertain any further features of interest in the manuscript, especially such details as may be of use to our typists. We assume that, with a little training, typists and proofreaders will be able to read the manuscript. The epigraphic assessment can verify this and advise as to any potential issues of confusion.

   - **Responsible party:** Department of Archaeology

#### Carbon date the manuscript

As noted above, there is at present no reason to doubt the dating of the manuscript. However historical dates are always uncertain and it is wise to confirm them using multiple independent methods wherever possible. Carbon dating is a widely used and relatively reliable method of dating ancient artifacts.

In 2007, radiocarbon dating of Gāndhāri manuscripts in Kharoṣṭhī script placed the oldest of them around 75 CE, making them the oldest extant Indian manuscripts. This project, as well as giving a firm historical context, attracted a great deal of publicity, raising the profile of Buddhist manuscript study. {Allon, M., Salomon, R., Jacobsen, G., Zoppi, U. (2007). Radiocarbon Dating of Kharosthi Fragments from the Schoyen and Senior Manuscript Collections. In Jens Braarvig (Eds.), BUDDHIST MANUSCRIPTS IN THE SCHØYEN COLLECTION vol. III, (pp. 279-291). Oslo, Norway: Hermes Publishing.}

I propose that we carbon date the DB CV, with the aim to confirm or refute the ascription of the manuscript to the 13th century. Together with the colophon and the epigraphic assessment, this will provide a solid basis for dating the manuscript.

To forestall any possible accusations of bias, I propose that the carbon dating be done by two separate institutions, one in Sri Lanka and one overseas. The Australian National University did the carbon dating for the Gandharan project, so perhaps they may be interested. The commercial cost of carbon dating is about US$ 500, so it is not prohibitive.

   - **Responsible party:** Department of Archaeology, possibly together with an overseas institution

#### Have the manuscript typed and proofread

This is the most critical part of the project, and the one that will take the most time and attention. It is crucial that the manuscript be typed with the utmost fidelity. The typists must avoid any temptation to reconcile or correct the readings. It is precisely the differences between DB CV and modern texts that is of interest.

In typing, it is not necessary to know the language. In fact, familiarity with Pali may be a disadvantage, as it may shape the typists' perceptions and expectations. Thus I propose:

- **Typing to be undertaken by a commercial typing firm, with proofreading done by Pali scholars or students.**

In a project such as this it is common to have the initial typing done *twice* independently, and the two versions compared. This, as scholars of the Theravada tradition would know, echoes the technique that legend says was used by Acariya Buddhaghosa. It is said that after writing the Visuddhimagga, the devas took it away, and he had to write it again; and then a third time also. Finally all three versions were compared side by side, and not one character was found to differ.

We are lucky these days to have very powerful "diffing" software, which can examine two texts and point out exactly any differences between them. I will describe below how this can be accomplished from a technical perspective.

One of the issues I have encountered in doing this sort of work is that experienced scholars are usually busy and have many projects. So if we expect them to devote many hundreds of hours to a project like this, we may have to wait a long time. Fortunately, much of the work can be done at a reasonable price by less experienced workers. We can then use the scholars' time efficiently by having them review the final work.

From a project management perspective, I propose the following:

1. Type the manuscript twice by a commercial firm.
2. The two versions are diffed, the differences compared with the manuscript images, and the two versions merged as one.
3. The merged text is further diffed against a modern edition of the same text, and any remaining typos or issues checked once more against the manuscript.

This will, I hope, produce an accurate text. Stages two and three would ideally be done by people with some knowledge of Pali, but they need not be experienced scholars. The job is not to assess the most likely or accurate reading, but simply to check what is in the manuscript. Thus I suggest we may be able to get students or graduates to do this. However it's possible that even these stages might be done by a commercial firm.

Once a reasonably accurate version is achieved, the final text can be supplied to scholars for perusal at their convenience.

The target script for the typing should be latin, as this has become the international standard. The [ISO 15919](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15919) conventions should be followed. For the convenience of the typists, it may be easiest to type in [Velthuis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velthuis) and convert to ISO 15919.

#### Publish digitally and in print

The primary medium for Pali publishing these days is online. Digital text is highly suited to Pali, as it enables us to deal with the large quantity of often obscure works. We will publish the text on SuttaCentral. Our platform will enable a reader to compare the text with other editions, and to see the images next to the text.

In addition, anyone else who wishes to publish the digital text may do so.

If anyone wishes to produce a paper edition, we can support this. SuttaCentral provides a workflow for exporting texts to PDF suitable for high-quality printing.

Since ISO 15919 supports Pali precisely, it is possibly to losslessly convert it to other scripts, especially those of Indic derivation. We do this automatically on SuttaCentral. So anyone who wants to publish in Sinhala or Devanagari script may do so.

#### Academic documentation

As the project is of considerable interest to Pali and other Indological scholars, it should be described in international journals. Such essays should document various aspects of the project, including:

1. Linguistic discussion.
2. Historical evidence.
3. Project methodology.
4. Artwork on the covers.
5. Investigation as to the provenance of the manuscript, and circumstances of its finding and preservation.

#### Publicity and popular awareness

The National Museum and/or other bodies may wish to publicize the work to raise awareness of Sri Lanka's textual history. This might consist of improvements to the museum display, website documentation, leaflets, and so on.
