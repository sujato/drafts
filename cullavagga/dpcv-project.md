# Dutiya-Parakkamabāhu Cullavagga Transcription Project

## Introduction

In the National Museum of Colombo there rests one of the oldest, and arguably most important, Pali manuscripts found anywhere in the world. It contains the Cullavagga, which consists of chapters 11–22 of the *Khandhaka* portion of the Pali Vinaya. The colophon in the manuscript indicates that it was copied during the reign of Parākramabāhu II, which would place it in the 13th century. Since almost all our current sources for Pali texts date from manuscripts of the 18th and 19th centuries, it is imperative that the Cullavagga text be digitally preserved and transcribed. In this project outline I set forth a proposal for how to accomplish this.

The aim of the project is to make available to scholars internationally the contents of this work for research. To enable this, we propose a comprehensive approach to preparing a digital text. This will include the following items:

- Review the manuscript to ascertain the state of preservation.
- Scan the manuscript into high-resolution images.
- Engage an epigraphic expert to assess the script.
- Carbon date the manuscript.
- Have the manuscript typed and carefully proofread.
- Publish digitally and in print.
- The text, as well as accompanying artwork and historical context, should be described in appropriate international journals.

To accomplish this will require the cooperation and goodwill of scholars, governmental organizations, and universities.

## Some details and terminology

So far as I know, the manuscript in question has not become known by any accepted abbreviation. For reference purposes, and especially for handling digital resources, it is useful to agree on a clear and consistent abbreviation and referencing system.

### Naming the manuscript

Since the manuscript is said to have been sponsored by King Parākramabāhu II, I propose that we name it after him. The Pali term would be Dutiya-Parakkamabāhu. (See [Dīpavaṁsa II 37.84](http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/2_pali/3_chron/dipav_2u.htm) *dutiya-parakkamabhuja*.) Thus I propose the following:

- **The manuscript be named the “Dutiya-Parakkamabāhu Cullavagga”, with the acronym DP Cv, or `dpcv` for programming contexts.**

<small>Note that, while the Sanskritic form of his name that I use here has become standard, in the Pali chronicles it appears as *parakkamabāhu* (or *parakkamabbāhu*). However, in texts such as the [Dīpamavamsa II](http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/2_pali/3_chron/dipav_2u.htm) and the [Mahāvaṁsa](http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/2_pali/3_chron/mahava_u.htm) the form *parakkamabhuja* is more common. *Bāhu* and *bhuja* are synonyms, both meaning “arm”. In the Mahāvaṁsa, for example, *parakkamabāhu* appears once only, while *parakkamabhuja* occurs 56 times. Until it is edited, of course, we cannot say what form is used in the manuscript itself. The Sanskritic drift of the king’s name is, aptly enough, an example of the kind of problem that we wish to address through studying this manuscript.</small>

### Naming the chapters

The Cullavagga is the second portion of the Khandhaka section of the Pali Vinaya. In the Khandhakas, it is preceded by the Mahāvagga, which consists of 10 chapters. The Cullavagga consists of 12 chapters; hopefully the manuscript contains all twelve, though this remains to be confirmed.

Thus we have:

- Pali Vinaya Khandhakas
  - Mahāvagga (10 chapters)
  - Cullavagga (12 chapters)

So for the numbering of chapters, I propose the following:

- **The chapters of the Cullavagga be named Kd 11–Kd 22, or `kd11`–`kd22` in programming contexts.**

This follows the conventions established on SuttaCentral, where Kd stands for Khandhaka, and the chapters are numbered as a simple increment.

<small>Note that the division between Mahāvagga and Cullavagga is not intrinsic to the texts, and does not correspond to any meaningful division of content. It is merely a division of convenience established for recitation and copying manuscripts. Other Vinayas in Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan all lack this division and simply organize this portion of the texts as Khandhakas (Skt. *skandhaka*, sometimes also called *vastu*, etc.).</small>

## Background

The texts of the Pali Tipiṭaka are our most important witness for the original teachings and person of the Buddha. Their significance has always been recognized in Theravada Buddhism, and became known internationally in the 19th century through the work of scholars such as [T.W. Rhys Davids](http://0-www.worldcat.org.novacat.nova.edu/identities/lccn-n50035648/) in England and [Bunyiu Nanjio](http://0-www.worldcat.org.novacat.nova.edu/identities/lccn-n81033028/) in Japan.

Pali texts were traditionally passed down on palm (or *ola*) leaf manuscripts. From the late 19th century into the 20th century these manuscripts have been transcribed and published in book form. From the 1990s the books have been digitized, and are now widely available in several editions on the internet. All this has greatly increased the availability of the Pali texts and has benefited scholars immensely.

However, in recent years scholars have paid greater attention to the problem of manuscript authenticity. Almost all of the manuscripts in existence date from the 18th and 19th centuries. This means that the entire Pali tradition rests on physical witnesses no more than a couple of centuries old. Linguistic, historical, and other evidence gives us good reason to be confident that the Pali texts are, on the whole, much older than this, and that they substantially date back to the time of the Buddha or shortly after. (See *The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts*, Sujato and Brahmali.) Nevertheless, we should not neglect the opportunity to further test and refine our understanding of the historical provenance of the Pali texts.

A further problem is that almost all the Sri Lankan manuscripts stem from texts that were imported from Burma or Thailand around the 18th century. Thus, although Burma and Thailand originally received their texts from Sri Lanka, we have little evidence for a Sri Lankan transmission that has not passed through those countries.

One project that contributed to this was the article by Oskar von Hinuber, *The Earliest Buddhist Manuscript*. This offers a transcription, description, and detailed study of a 8th–9th century Pali manuscript from Nepal by a leading Pali philologist. As it happens, the text itself, while only a few pages, is from the Cullavagga. Thus is a small portion of the same text found in the
