Dear Sir or Madam,

Re: Scanning and digitizing the Cullavagga

It was with great delight and not a little surprise that I came across an ancient manuscript of the Pali Cullavagga in the National Library in Colombo recently. As soon as I saw it I recognized its great value and interest for studying Pali and Buddhism and realized the need for a digital edition of the text for use by Pali scholars. With this letter I would like to propose to you the establishing of a project to do just that.

But first, a little background. My name is Bhante Sujato, and I am an Australian bhikkhu, ordained in 1994 in the Ajahn Chah tradition in Thailand. Since 2005 I have been running a website called SuttaCentral, which gathers early Buddhist texts in Pali, Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan. Recently I spent over two years in retreat in Taiwan, during which time I completed a full translation of the four main Pali *nikāyas* into English.

In recent years, Pali scholars internationally have shown an increasing interest in investigating the Pali manuscript tradition. Most of our current Pali texts are based on manuscripts that are no more than a century or two old. While we believe, on good grounds, that these are reliable witnesses for a much earlier textual tradition, it is important to establish this as firmly as possible.

The Cullavagga is a major text of early Buddhism, containing twelve chapters (*khandhakas*) dealing with various matters of monastic conduct. It includes much of interest and importance, including detailed information on monastic life, an early version of the story of Devadatta, the account of the establishing of the *bhikkhunī* order, and the histories of the first and second councils.

Dating from the 13th century, the Cullavagga manuscript is no less than 5 centuries older than most of our current sources. In addition, the manuscript is in unusually good condition. It's value lies not just in its age, however, for it is inscribed with a colophon that tells us the name of the scribe and the king who sponsored it, Parakkamabahu II. Such solid evidence of provenance is exceedingly rare in our field.

Its position in the reign of King Parakkamabahu II places the manuscript at a critical juncture in the development of Theravada Buddhism. It was at this time that the Pali Tipitaka was adopted by Thailand and Myanmar. Given the royal sponsorship of this text, it is plausible to assume that this edition, or something very much like it, formed the basis of the Pali Tipitakas in those lands.

Moreover, the text predates the classical grammar of the Saddanīti. Concern has been raised to what extent Pali texts may have been Sanskritized under the influence of this grammar. Having an extensive text that predates this would allow us to investigate the extent to which there may have been any shift in the spelling of Pali.

Here is an initial proposal for the scope of the project as I envisage it.

1. Investigate the microfilm copy of the manuscript to determine the quality of the images.
2. If it is *not* possible to use the microfilm, then have the manuscript scanned in high-resolution images.
3. Engage an epigraphic expert to determine the exact nature of the script.
4. Have the manuscript typed.
5. Publish digitally, and perhaps in print.
6. The text, as well as accompanying artwork and historical context, should be described in appropriate journal articles. Note, however, that the primary scope of the work is to make the text available for scholars, not to do a detailed study of it at this stage.
