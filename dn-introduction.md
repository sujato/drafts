# Introducing the Long Discourses

The Dīgha Nikāya is the first of the four main collections in the Sutta Piṭaka of the Pali Canon (*tipiṭaka*). It is translated here as <cite>Long Discourses</cite>. As the title suggests, its discourses are somewhat longer than those of other *nikāyas*. There are, however, only 34 discourses in the collection, so despite the length of the individual discourses, the collection as a whole is by far the shortest of the *nikāyas*.

It is distinguished from the other *nikāyas* by the more fully developed and sophisticated literary forms, and by the audience, which strongly emphasizes the lay community, especially the self-proclaimed spiritual leaders, the brahmins. The brahmins, of course, were the custodians of the most sophisticated texts in ancient India up to this time. It seems the composition of the Dīgha was intended to impress and convert such learned men.

## How the Dīgha is Organized

The 34 discourses are grouped in three *vaggas*. The first *vagga* consists of thirteen discourses, each of which includes a lengthy passage on the spiritual practice of a monastic, known as the Gradual Training (*anupubbasikkhā*). This section begins with hearing the teaching and going forth, continues with a detailed account of monastic ethics, and culminates in advanced meditation and realization. Similar passages are found throughout the remainder of the Pali canon, as well as in the parallels in other languages. It is clearly a foundational document in the life of the Sangha, and gives what is probably the most detailed account of monastic life before the composition of the Vinaya. It is an odd thing, then, that the discourses in this section are all delivered to lay people.

In the second *vagga* we find a number of discourses of a more biographical nature. DN 15 <cite>Mahāpadāna</cite> tells of past Buddhas, while DN 16 <cite>Mahāparinibbāna</cite> tells of Siddhattha's last days. A number of discourses in this section are closely related to the Mahāparinibbāna, consisting of episodes or tales that are sometimes mentioned in brief there but have been spun off to become individual discourses in their own right. These include ???.

The final *vagga* is more miscellaneous in nature. It includes long poetic sections, proto-Abhidhammic doctrinal compilations, and narratives that are often humurous and occasionally border on farce.
