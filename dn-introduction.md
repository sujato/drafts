# Introducing the Long Discourses

The Dīgha Nikāya is the first of the four main collections in the Sutta Piṭaka of the Pali Canon (*tipiṭaka*). It is translated here as <cite>Long Discourses</cite>. As the title suggests, its discourses are somewhat longer than those of other *nikāyas*. There are, however, only 34 discourses in the collection, so despite the length of the individual discourses, the collection as a whole is by far the shortest of the *nikāyas*.

It is distinguished from the other *nikāyas* by the more fully developed and sophisticated literary forms, and by the audience, which strongly emphasizes the lay community, especially the self-proclaimed spiritual leaders, the brahmins. The brahmins, of course, were the custodians of the most sophisticated texts in ancient India up to this time. It seems that one aim of the composition of the Dīgha was to impress and convert such learned men.

The other overriding theme of the Dīgha is the passing away of the Buddha. The centerpiece of the collection is the <cite>Mahāparinibbāna Sutta</cite>, a discourse of unrivaled importance.

## How the Dīgha is Organized

The 34 discourses are grouped in three *vaggas*. The first *vagga* consists of thirteen discourses, each of which includes a lengthy passage on the spiritual practice of a monastic, known as the Gradual Training (*anupubbasikkhā*). This section begins with hearing the teaching and going forth, continues with a detailed account of monastic ethics, and culminates in advanced meditation and realization. Similar passages are found throughout the remainder of the Pali canon, as well as in the parallels in other languages. It is clearly a foundational document in the life of the Sangha, and gives what is probably the most detailed account of monastic life before the composition of the Vinaya. It is an odd thing, then, that the discourses in this section are all delivered to lay people.

In the second *vagga* we find a number of discourses of a more biographical nature. DN 15 <cite>Mahāpadāna</cite> tells of past Buddhas, while DN 16 <cite>Mahāparinibbāna</cite> tells of Siddhattha's last days. In addition, a number of other discourses in this section are closely related to the Mahāparinibbāna. I will discuss this cycle further below.

The final *vagga* is more miscellaneous in nature. It includes long poetic sections, proto-Abhidhammic doctrinal compilations, and narratives that are often humorous and occasionally border on farce.

## The Mahāparinibbāna Cycle

In several instances, episodes  mentioned in brief in the <cite>Mahāparinibbāna</cite> have been spun off and expanded to become individual discourses in their own right. Thus the <cite>Mahāparinibbāna</cite> dominates much of the Dīgha, not just through its own length and thematic weight, but through its influence and connections with other discourses.

In my view, this cycle of suttas was likely composed by Ānanda and his students, beginning this great literary work with the <cite>Mahāparinibbāna Sutta</cite> itself, and gradually branching off into related works. The cycle as a whole shows not only Ānanda’s characteristic personal love and devotion for the Buddha, but also reveals a concern for what is to come, for the fate of the Dhamma in the years after the Buddha’s passing. Ānanda survived the Buddha for several decades, and his legacy was establishing the texts and the memory of the Buddha.

One distinctive unifying detail of these discourses is that they do not end with the standard phrase saying that the listeners rejoiced in the teachings, but instead finish directly with a teaching or a verse on the subject of impermanence or the long-lasting of the dispensation.

- DN 16 <cite>Mahāparinibbāna</cite> (“The Great Discourse on the Buddha’s Extinguishment”): Beginning with King Ajātasattu of Magadha declaring his intent to invade the Vajjis, and ending with the peaceful distribution of the Buddha’s relics to the potentially warring nations and clans, the story of the Buddha’s last journeys is as political as it is spiritually moving. Throughout, the theme of impermanence unifies the diverse events and teachings. The weight of constructing such an epic shows, however, in the considerable differences between extent versions of the text. Many of the extra repetitious sections—such as the apparently superfluous sets of eight in the early portion of the narrative—are not found in all parallels. It seems that over time, more and more material was added, and at certain points portions of the text were split off to form other discourses in the cycle.
- DN 17 <cite>Mahāsudassana</cite>: In a small scene of the <cite>Mahāparinibbāna</cite>, Ānanda encourages the Buddha to pass away in a well-known city, not in the obscure village of Kusinārā. The Buddha rebukes him, saying that in the past it had been a great city. The Sanskrit (Sarvāstivāda) versions of the <cite>Mahāparinibbāna</cite> include a shorter account of the story of King Mahāsudassana in their <cite>Mahāparinibbāna</cite> itself, but in the Pali it has become greatly extended and formed into its own long discourse. The discourse itself is fabulous, full of extended passages on the crystal balustrades and other wonders of  Mahāsudassana’s palace. But at its heart is a very human story: the love of the queen for her king, and the pain of letting go. The struggle that the queen undergoes to fully understand that her king must pass mirrors the struggles of Ānanda in the <cite>Mahāparinibbāna</cite> as he comes to terms with the passing of his beloved Teacher.
- DN 18 <cite>Janavasabha</cite>: Like DN 17, this begins with a short passage extracted from the <cite>Mahāparinibbāna</cite>, to which has been added an extended narrative. During the journey in the <cite>Mahāparinibbāna</cite>, Ānanda asks the Buddha to reveal the fate after death of devotees in the town of Nādika. Characteristically, it ends with the Buddha showing how people may know for themselves their own spiritual progress. This short passage is preserved as an independent discourse also in SN 55.10. In DN 18, however, the discourse continues with a long story of the doings of the gods, as told by the spirit Janavasabha. It culminates by saying that this discourses was learned by the Buddha from Janavasabha, and from there was taught to Ānanda, and he informed the assemblies of monks, nuns, laymen, and lay women, resulting in the Buddha’s dispensation being famous and successful among gods and men. This corroborates the idea that these discourses, shaped by Ānanda, were aimed at ensuring the long-lasting of Buddhism.
- DN 28 <cite>Sampasādanīya</cite> (“Inspiring Confidence”): The <cite>Mahāparinibbāna</cite> records an incident where Sāriputta, the Buddha’s foremost disciple, comes to him and makes a “lion’s roar” of his faith in the Buddha, based on his understanding of Dhamma. This is recorded as an independent discourse at SN 47.12. We also have a short discourse at SN 47.13 that tells of Sāriputta’s death. This echoes the themes of the <cite>Mahāparinibbāna</cite>, even including the famous saying that one should be one’s own refuge. Clearly this must have happened during the journey recorded in the <cite>Mahāparinibbāna</cite>. Oddly, however, it is not included in DN 16, and in addition, it situates the Buddha in Sāvatthī, far from the track of his journey. Regardless, the passage on the lion’s roar was expanded into its own extensive discourse, with Sāriputta expounding at length on various inspiring qualities of the Buddha. This gives an opportunity to list many standard doctrinal teachings. Like DN 18, the sutta ends with an exhortation to share the teaching.

In addition to texts that have a direct literary and narrative connection with the <cite>Mahāparinibbāna</cite>, there is a further series of discourses that share a more indirect or thematic conection.

- DN 14 <cite>Mahāpadāna</cite> (“The Harvest of Deeds”): The Buddha gives biographical details of six past Buddha, as well as a lengthy account of the life of one of them, Vipassī. This discourse establishes the historical Buddha Siddhattha as one of a series of world teachers that stretch back into the deep past, and whose dispensations all follow similar patterns.
- DN 29 <cite>Pāsādika</cite> (“An Impressive Discourse”): This begins with the story of the passing away of the Jain leader Mahāvīra (Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta). In the Buddhist texts, this is depicted as a disaster for the Jains, as they fell apart in conflict right away. Whether this is historically accurate or not, the Buddha took it as an opportunity to teach the qualities that make a religious movement last long after the passing of the founder. Discourses in response to this are found at DN 29, MN 104, and DN 33. In the current sutta, contrasting his own dispensation with what he claims was the inadequacy of Jain techings, the Buddha declares that the faith and practice of his followers is well-grounded, since it is based on genuine Awakening.
- DN 30 <cite>Lakkhaṇa</cite> (“The Marks of a Great Man”): The early texts refer several times to a mysterious set of bodily characteristics known as the “marks of a great man”. These are said to fulfill a brahmanical prophecy that one who possesses such marks will either become a universal emperor or a fully awakened Buddha. Normally when the suttas present something as a brahmanical teaching, it is in fact found in brahmanical texts. But in this case no trace of such a doctrine has been found. The origins of this mythological idea are obscure. The story of the two paths is a classic mythological theme, found in the oldest known myth, the story of Gilgamesh. The marks of a great man exist as a curious counterpoint to the rational teachings found in most of the suttas. In this particular sutta, the Buddha is said to have explained each mark as a consequence of a specific kind of kammic deed. The literary and verse styles betray this as a late composition, and it has no real parallel in other collections. Nevertheless, it remains as a testament to the evolution of the idea of the Buddha, relating his spiritual qualities to his physical presence.
- DN 33 <cite>Saṅgīti</cite> (“Reciting in Concert”): Like DN 29, this discourse is set after the death of Mahāvīra. Speaking to the Mallians of Pāvā—who appear also in the <cite>Mahāparibbāna</cite> the Buddha asks Sāriputta to speak on his behalf. This echoes the theme of DN 27 and DN 28, that it is the disciples who will be responsible for the continuation of the teachings. Sāriputta gives an extensive systematic presentation of doctrines, using the Aṅguttara principle of organizing teachings by number. The monastics are encouraged to recite these teachings in concert, so that they may be preserved and the dispensation continued for a long time. This discourse anticipates the systematic tendencies of the Abhidhamma, and indeed one of the Sarvāstivādin Abhidhamma texts (<cite>Saṅgītiparyāya</cite>) consists of an expansion and commentary on this discourse.
- DN 34 <cite>Dasuttara</cite> (“Up to Ten”): This is similar to the <cite>Saṅgīti</cite>, but with a briefer narrative context and even more systematic style. Here the Buddha no longer appears, and the discourse is simply spoken by Sāriputta.
