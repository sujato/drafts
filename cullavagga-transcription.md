Dear Sir or Madam,

Re: Digitizing the Cullavagga manuscript of Parākramabāhu II

It was with great delight and not a little surprise that I recently came across an ancient manuscript of the Pali Cullavagga in the National Library in Colombo. As soon as I saw it I recognized its great value and interest, and realized the need for a digital edition of the text for use by Pali scholars. With this letter Venerable Abhayatissa and myself would like to propose the establishing of a project to scan and digitize the manuscript.

In recent years, Pali scholars internationally have shown an increasing interest in investigating the Pali manuscript tradition. Most of our current Pali texts are based on manuscripts that are no more than a century or two old. While we believe, on good grounds, that these are reliable witnesses for a much earlier textual tradition, it is important to establish this as firmly as possible.

The Cullavagga is a major text consisting of twelve chapters (*khandhakas*) in the Pali Vinaya Piṭaka. It includes much of interest and importance, including detailed information on monastic life, an early version of the story of Devadatta, the account of the establishing of the *bhikkhunī* order, and the histories of the first and second Councils.

Dating from the 13th century, the Parākramabāhu II Cullavagga manuscript is no less than five centuries older than most of our current sources. It is one of the few surviving Pali manuscripts that pre-dates the importing of manuscripts from Burma and Thailand in the 18th century. In addition, the manuscript is in unusually good condition.

Its value lies not just in its age, however, for it is inscribed with a colophon that tells us the book was copied by Sumedha Mahāthera under the patronage of King Parākramabāhu. Such solid evidence of provenance is exceedingly rare in the field of early Buddhist manuscripts.

Here is an initial proposal for the scope of the project.

1. Scan the manuscript in high-resolution images.
2. Engage an epigraphic expert to assess the script.
3. Have the manuscript typed and carefully proofread.
4. Publish digitally, and perhaps in print.
5. The text, as well as accompanying artwork and historical context, should be described in appropriate international journals.

In addition, if it is possible to carbon date the manuscript, this would place the dating on an even more solid footing.

The manuscript is the property of the Department of Archaeology, and is currently on display in the National Museum of Colombo. We respectfully request the permission of these two bodies to undertake this project. We envisage that it will be a project of national and international cooperation, involving a number of experts in the field. If there is a positive response to this initial letter, we will proceed to make a detailed proposal.

Should there be any questions, please do not hesitate to contact myself or Venerable Abhayatissa.
