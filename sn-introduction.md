# The Linked Discourses: the blueprint for Buddhist philosophy

The Saṁyutta Nikāya is the third of the four main divisions in the Sutta Piṭaka of the Pali Canon (*tipiṭaka*). It is translated here as <cite>Linked Discourses</cite>, and is sometimes known as the <cite>Connected Discourses</cite>. As the title suggests, its discourses are grouped thematically. These thematic groups of texts are called *saṁyuttas*, and the Saṁyutta Nikāya is the collection of such *saṁyuttas*.

The Saṁyutta Nikāya consists of 56 *saṁyuttas* collected in five large “books” (*vagga*), containing over a thousand discourses. The Mahāsaṅgīti text as used on SuttaCentral contains 2837 discourses; but the total number of discourses is somewhat arbitrary, as it depends on how the abbreviated texts are expanded, and this differs in different editions. This variation, however, applies only to the way the texts are counted, and does not affect the content, which is almost identical in every edition.

It is in the Saṁyutta Nikāya that we find the core doctrines that have formed the basis for all subsequent Buddhist philosophy. While the text itself does not spell out its organizational principles, the major doctrinal sections correspond with the template of the four noble truths.

1. Suffering
  - Aggregates (SN 22)
  - Six sense media (SN 35)
2. The origin of suffering
  - Dependent origination (SN 12)
3. The cessation of suffering
  - The unconditioned (SN 43)
4. The practice that leads to the end of suffering
  - The chapters of the final book, the Mahāvagga (SN 45–54)

The four noble truths themselves are treated in the final chapter, the Saccasaṁyutta (SN 56).

Not all the *saṁyuttas* fit so easily into this scheme. There are many minor *saṁyuttas*, which are sometimes connected with a major *saṁyutta*, and sometimes are independent. In addition, the first book, the Sagathāvagga, is not organized by subject. Rather, the thematic linking here is the type of person involved in the discourse. These texts are also unified in literary form; they are in mixed prose and verse.

This collection has a full parallel in the Saṁyuktāgama (SA) of the Sarvāstivāda school in Chinese translation. In addition, there are two partial collections in Chinese (SA-2 and SA-3) as well as a number of miscellaneous or fragmentary texts in Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan. Much of the organizational structure of SN is shared with SA, suggesting that this structure preceded the split between these two collections.

## The Book With Verses

The “Book With Verses” is the first of the five books of the Linked Discourses. It is divided into eleven <i>saṁyuttas</i> or “sections”, with a total of 271 suttas. Most of these are further subdivided into <i>vaggas</i> of ten suttas. The word <i>vagga</i> is thus used of both the major overarching “book” and the subsidiary “chapter”. Each of the suttas in this collection contains verse with a prose narrative structure, although in many cases the prose has been omitted through abbreviation. Where most of the Saṁyutta is organized around subject matter, here the organizational principle is people. Each <i>saṁyutta</i> contains conversation involving the Buddha or his disciples with a different person or kind of person, such as gods, kings, nuns, or brahmins. A typical sutta has a bare narrative framework, where someone comes to the Buddha and utters a verse, and the Buddha replies with a better one. In some cases, notably the Sakkasaṁyutta, the narrative element is developed into a lively exchange. Some of the texts in this collection are well known and widely quoted, such as the invitation of Brahmā or the nun Vajirā’s simile of the person as a chariot. Most of the suttas here have parallels in the Chinese Saṁyukāgama translations; the partial translations SA 2 and SA 3 include Sagāthāvagga material. In addition, many of the verses have parallels elsewhere throughout the Buddhist literature in all languages.

## SN 1: Linked Discourses on Deities

The “Linked Discourses on Deities” contains 81 discourses, each one of which depicts the Buddha in conversation with a deity. Typically a deity approaches the Buddha in the monastery at Sāvatthī, illuminating the night with their glory. The deity addresses the Buddha with a question or verse, which may be a praise, a challenge, a riddle, or simply a reflection. The Buddha responds, usually elevating the discourse to a higher plane. As always in Buddhist texts, a deity is not worshiped, but is regarded as a temporary rebirth in a higher plane; the deities learn from the Buddha, not the other way around. In most cases, the narrative framework is slim, and after a while it is dropped entirely, retaining just the verses. There’s no particular theme to the discourses, which range from the simple to the profound.

## SN 2: Linked Discourses on Gods

The “Linked Discourses on Gods” contains 30 discourses, each one of which depicts the Buddha in conversation with a god. Here the term <i>devaputta</i> is used, rather than <i>devatā</i> in the previous <i>saṁyutta</i>. The difference is purely nominal and there is no difference in the meaning. The style of discourses is similar to the “Linked Discourses on Deities”, although here there is a greater emphasis on the theme of renunciation. A number of these discourses are regularly recited in modern Theravāda; the Tāyana verses on diligent striving at SN 2.8 are often recited by monastics, while the discourses on the sun and the moon (SN 2.9 and SN 2.10) are popular protection chants, which are also found in Tibetan.

## SN 3: Linked Discourses with the Kosalan

The “Linked Discourses with the Kosalan” contains 25 discourses featuring King Pasenadi of Kosala. Pasenadi shines through in the early texts as a complex human figure, one with foibles and foolishness, but with a great devotion and capacity to grow. He appears frequently elsewhere in the suttas; MN 87 tells the story of how Queen Mallikā led him to the Dhamma. Here Mallikā appears again, and in SN 3.8 she shows how she is not afraid to challenge her king. The suttas in this collection typically set the verses in substantive prose narratives, illustrating the struggles and problems that beset a king intent on Dhamma who must nonetheless rule in a world with spies, sacrifices, punishments, wars, and the many temptations of royal life.

## SN 4: Linked Discourses with Māra

The “Linked Discourses with Māra” contains 25 discourses featuring Māra, the god of temptation, deceit, and death. In these discourses, Māra typically appears in some terrifying or beguiling form, hoping to disturb the Buddha, or else he challenges the Buddha with a critical verse. Like the previous section, the narrative prose here is substantive. The Buddha recognizes him at once and exposes his deceit in a verse. Māra also appears throughout the next collection, where the nuns take him on.

## SN 5: Linked Discourses with Nuns

The “Linked Discourses with Nuns” contains 10 discourses describing occasions when various nuns retreat to a forest for meditation, only to be challenged by Māra. The verses here partly overlap with the Therīgāthā, though there are some that are unique to this context, and we also have a prose narrative to flesh out the context. Māra’s challenges are various; sometimes he is sexist, alleging that women are weak in wisdom (SN 5.2). Several of these short texts are among the most frequently quoted of all the suttas.

## SN 6: Linked Discourses with Brahmās

The “Linked Discourses with Brahmās” contains 15 discourses featuring high brahmanical deities. Most commonly we meet the “Great Brahmā”, regarded as the creator God, but he is merely one of a class of deities, and here we meet several others. Brahmā is depicted here and elsewhere in early Buddhist texts in a respectful way, regarded as a glorious deity reborn in his realm due to powerful good kamma. As here, he frequently acts as a champion for the Buddhist cause. However, like all the gods, he is still under the influence of delusion and has nor escaped rebirth.

## SN 7: Linked Discourses with Brahmins

The “Linked Discourses with Brahmins” contains 22 discourses featuring the Buddha interacting with various members of the brahmanical caste. The brahmins were the custodians of the brahmanical scriptures and traditions, and saw themselves as the spiritual elite of society. A central platform of the Buddha’s ethical teaching was that one’s worth is determined by one’s deeds, not by caste. This was a direct challenge to brahmanical authority, and a number of discourses have an understandably combative air to them. But the brahmins were a diverse community, and it’s just as common to find them relating to the Buddha with respect and gratitude.

## SN 8: Linked Discourses with Vaṅgīsa

The “Linked Discourses with Vaṅgīsa” contains 12 discourses with verses spoken by Vaṅgīsa, the most renowned poet of early Buddhism. His verses have a sophistication and personal vulnerability that stamp them as perhaps the most distinctive literary voice of the early texts. Several of these discourses speak of his insecurities and struggles, and how he was helped to overcome them. Others speak from his joyous devotion to the Buddha and the Saṅgha, and of his final triumph.

## SN 9: Linked Discourses in the Woods

The “Linked Discourses in the Woods” contains 14 discourses with verses telling the experiences of certain monks living the woods. Typically the monk is slack or negligent in some way, and a deity appears to call them out and encourage them to greater diligence.

## SN 10: Linked Discourses with Spirits

The “Linked Discourses with Spirits” contains 12 discourses with verses telling the encounters between the Buddha—or in one case the monk Anuruddha—and various spirits (<i>yahhka</i>). The spirits were local deities worshiped in ancient India, of a lower order than the gods and Brahmās. While in later forms of Buddhism, such spirits were typically depicted as malevolent or dangerous, in the early texts they are more ambivalent, and many of them are friendly, merely asking Dhamma questions, or extolling Dhamma virtues like mindfulness. That’s not to say they couldn’t be scary, and several discourses reveal a more ferocious aspect. Particularly interesting is the emphasis on the love that the female spirits feel for their children.

## SN 11: Linked Discourses with Sakka

The “Linked Discourses with Sakka” contains 25 discourses with verses telling stories involving Sakka, the Lord of the Thirty-Three gods. Many of these discourses are relatively lengthy, featuring substantive prose and extended dialogues in verse. Sakka is shown devoted to the Buddha, defending Buddhist virtues of kindness and forgiveness, even in the waging of war with the demons.

## The Book of Causation

The “Book of Causation” is the second of the five books of the Linked Discourses. It is named after the first and longest <i>saṁyutta</i>, which deals with causation through the core Buddhist teaching of Dependent Origination. The remaining nine <i>saṁyuttas</i> deal with miscellaneous secondary themes, some organized by subject, others by person.

## SN 12: Linked Discourses on Causation

The “Linked Discourses on Causation” is a major collection containing 93 discourses on the core Buddhist teaching of dependent origination. Dependent origination presents a series of conditional links laying bare how suffering originates and how it ends. As such, it is an extended treatment of the second and third noble truths. It integrates psychological and existential aspects of suffering, showing how when bound by attachment we make choices that bind us to transmigrating into future lives. One of the core purposes is to explain how rebirth takes place without having to invoke metaphysical concepts such as a “soul”. The collection begins by defining each of the terms in the standard 12-linked chain, definitions which are assumed to apply throughout. Remaining discourses iterate on this theme, introducing new perspectives and formulations.

## SN 13: Linked Discourses on the Breakthrough

The “Linked Discourses on the Breakthrough” contains 11 discourses on the value of realizing the Dhamma. Each discourse features a memorable simile illustrating the truly momentous implications of seeing the four noble truths.

## SN 14: Linked Discourses on the Elements

The “Linked Discourses on the Elements” contains 39 discourses on various factors classified as “elements” (<i>dhātu</i>). In Buddhism, the term “element” is applied to a range of phenomena, most commonly the main material properties of earth, water, fire and air. Here, however, these four elements play only a small role, and much of the text is devoted to analysis of the perceptual process, and to various character traits. The relation or dependence of elements on each other is a major theme, and this chapter can be seen as an appendix to the chapter on causality.

## SN 15: Linked Discourses on the Unknowable Beginning

The “Linked Discourses on the Unknowable Beginning” contains 20 discourses that speak of how the ultimate origin of the process of transmigration (<i>saṁsāra</i>) is unknowable. This theme is a direct counter to the hubris of the creation myths found in most religions, which confidently recount events which are in fact permanently hidden from view. The Buddha emphasized that transmigration has been ongoing for a fathomless period of time, illustrating it with a series of powerful similes.

## SN 16: Linked Discourses with Kassapa

The “Linked Discourses with Kassapa” contains 13 discourses featuring one of the most famous of the Buddha’s disciples, the monk Kassapa. Kassapa was an ascetic and diligent practitioner, whose sometimes critical voice was tempered by a love of nature and a tender concern for the lay community. These discourses show his magnificent spiritual attainments, and his overriding concern for the health and longevity of the Buddhist community.

## SN 17: Linked Discourses on Gains and Honor

The “Linked Discourses on Gains and Honor” contains 43 discourses warning the mendicants of the terrible dangers inherent in material possessions and love of popularity and honors.

## SN 18: Linked Discourses with Rāhula

The “Linked Discourses with Rāhula” contains 22 discourses with the Buddha interrogating his son Rāhula on fundamental doctrines such as the aggregates or sense fields.

## SN 19: Linked Discourses with Lakkhaṇa

The “Linked Discourses with Lakkhaṇa” contains 21 discourses with the Buddha featuring the monk Lakkhaṇa (“Mark”). Through his psychic powers he sees beings in various states of torment and distress, and describes them to the Buddha.

## SN 20: Linked Discourses with Similes

The “Linked Discourses with Similes” contains 12 discourses with parables or similes illustrating diverse points of the teaching. This chapter highlights the Buddha’s skill in choosing vivid and suitable similes for any occasion.

## SN 21: Linked Discourses with Monks

The “Linked Discourses with Monks” contains 12 discourses featuring different monks. Unlike the chapter on nuns, this does not use a consistent template, but depicts a diverse range of scenarios. Each case shows a personal challenge or spiritual triumph, shedding a light on the life of the monks.

## sn-khandhavaggasamyutta: Book of the Aggregates

The “Book of the Aggregates” is the third of the five books of the Linked Discourses. It is named after the first and longest <i>saṁyutta</i>, which deals with the core Buddhist teaching of the five aggregates. Of the remaining twelve <i>saṁyuttas</i>, three also take up the theme of the aggregates, while the remainder deal with miscellaneous secondary themes, some organized by subject, others by person.

## SN 22: Linked Discourses on the Aggregates

The “Linked Discourses on the Aggregates” contains 159 discourses on the core doctrinal topic of the five aggregates. This term was introduced in the first sermon as the summary of the noble truth of suffering, and became a foundational teaching in all forms of Buddhism. The basic idea of an “aggregate” is a set or class of phenomena. The five are form (<i>rūpa</i>, i.e. “physical phenomena”, or sometimes simply “body”; note that in Buddhism, <i>rūpa</i> includes all things with material properties such as shape and color, including visions perceived only in the mind), feeling (<i>vedanā</i>, i.e. the pleasant, painful, or neutral tone of experience), perception (<i>saññā</i>, i.e. the recognition or interpretation of experience, <em>not</em> sense awareness), choices (<i>saṅkhārā</i>, i.e. intention, will, or volition; the choice to perform an act, especially one with an ethical dimension), and consciousness (<i>vịññāṇa</i>, i.e. the subjective process of awareness itself). The “aggregates” are the various different phenomena so classified. Almost always, they are referred to as the “aggregates connected with grasping” (<i>upādānakkhandha</i>). The relation between “grasping” and “aggregate” encompasses a number of aspects. The aggregates are the <em>subject</em> of grasping, in that they are the things that are normally attached to and taken to be the permanent “self”. But they are not merely passive spectators: they are also the <em>functional support</em> of grasping, the things that make grasping work. As active participants in the process of grasping, they <em>stimulate</em> grasping to themselves (<i>upādāniya</i>). And finally, they are the <em>product</em> of grasping in the sense that attachments in past lives have given rise to the aggregates in this life (<i>upādinna</i>). One of the key functions of the aggregates is to categorize theories of the self. From the discourses, non-Buddhists seem to be familiar with this, yet we cannot identify the aggregates in any pre-Buddhist texts. Regardless of whether the set of categories was pre-Buddhist, the Buddha treated them in his own distinctive way, emphasizing that nothing in the aggregates was a permanent self or soul. In this collection we find a large number of striking and lively narratives, showing how the aggregates could be a solace at the time of death, a guide to the knotty theoretical debates on identity, or a framework for insight meditation. Many of the short abbreviated texts are built from the same templates employed in the “Linked Discourses on the Six Sense Fields”.

## SN 23: Linked Discourses with Rādha

The “Linked Discourses with Rādha” contains 46 discourses with a monk named Rādha on the topic of the five aggregates, and may be considered as an appendix to the previous <i>saṁyutta</i>.

## SN 24: Linked Discourses on Views

The “Linked Discourses on Views” contains 96 discourses on views, methodically analyzed through the lens of the aggregates. A wide variety of views is assessed, most of which are familiar from elsewhere in the canon, although the first one is unique.

## SN 25: Linked Discourses on Arrival

The “Linked Discourses on Arrival” is the first of three similar sections, each of which takes a set of ten doctrinal items (shared also with SN 18 Rāhula) and presents it according to a set pattern. The current chapter focuses on the distinction between those who accept the teachings by either faith or intellectual understanding, and those who have realized them for themselves.

## SN 26: Linked Discourses on Arising

The “Linked Discourses on Arising” is the second of three similar sections, each of which takes a set of ten doctrinal items and presents it according to a set pattern. The current chapter focuses on the fact that anyone who has these things will suffer.

## SN 27: Linked Discourses on Corruptions

The “Linked Discourses on Corruptions” is the third of three similar sections, each of which takes a set of ten doctrinal items and presents it according to a set pattern. The current chapter focuses on the fact that desire for these things is a corruption of the mind.

## SN 28: Linked Discourses with Sāriputta

The “Linked Discourses with Sāriputta” describes Sāriputta’s deep meditation practice, and his conversations with Ānanda, who noticed how radiant and glowing he was. An exception to this pattern is the final sutta, which depicts Sāriputta responding to the challenges of a female wanderer.

## SN 29: Linked Discourses on Dragons

The “Linked Discourses on Dragons” is the first of four similar sections dealing with the modes in which various semi-celestial beings may be reborn. The current chapter is on the “dragons” or <i>nāgas</i>, a powerful but morally ambiguous serpentine creature of the waterways.

## SN 30: Linked Discourses on Phoenixes

The “Linked Discourses on Phoenixes” is the second of four similar sections dealing with the modes in which various semi-celestial beings may be reborn. The current chapter is on the “phoenixes” or <i>supaṇṇas</i>, otherwise known as <i>garuḍa</i>, powerful bird-spirits that are the natural antagonists to the dragons in Indian mythology.

## SN 31: Linked Discourses on Fairies

The “Linked Discourses on Fairies” is the third of four similar sections dealing with the modes in which various semi-celestial beings may be reborn. The current chapter is on the “fairies” or <i>gandhabbas</i>, who take on a number of benign aspects as minor deities associated with music, childbirth, and as here, plants.

## SN 32: Linked Discourses on Cloud Gods

The “Linked Discourses on Cloud Gods” is the last of four similar sections dealing with the modes in which various semi-celestial beings may be reborn. The current chapter is on the “cloud gods” or <i>valāhakas</i>, who are deities of the weather controlling the clouds.

## SN 33: Linked Discourses with Vacchagotta

The “Linked Discourses with Vacchagotta” contains 55 discourses, each with a philosophical inquiry by the wanderer Vacchagotta. These do not exhaust his questions; he also appears in a number of other discourses, notably MN 71–73, where he resolves his doubts and becomes perfected. The current chapter shows him repeatedly raising the question of the ten speculative views, and why they appear. The discourses are entirely formulaic and appear to have been produced from a template. Unusually for a section of this length, it lacks <i>vaggas</i>.

## SN 34: Linked Discourses on Absorption

The “Linked Discourses on Absorption” (Jhānasaṁyutta) is also known as the “Linked Discourses on Immersion” (Samādhisaṁyutta). It contains 55 discourses dealing with the meditative skills required to perfect absorption. Each discourse describes a meditator who is skilled in some aspects, but not in others, and holds the one skilled in all aspects to be the best.

## sn-salayatanavaggasamyutta: Book of the Six Sense Fields

The “Book of the Six Sense Fields” is the fourth of the five books of the Linked Discourses. It is named after the first and longest <i>saṁyutta</i>, which deals with the core Buddhist teaching of the six sense fields. The second <i>saṁyutta</i> on Feelings also deals with a major doctrinal topic. The remaining eight <i>saṁyuttas</i> deal with miscellaneous secondary themes, some organized by subject, others by person.

## SN 35: The number of discourses in the “Linked Discourses on the Six Sense Fields”

The number of discourses in the “Linked Discourses on the Six Sense Fields” varies between editions, mainly due to the way repetitions are counted; SuttaCentral follows Bhikkhu Bodhi’s translation in counting 248 discourses. The six sense fields complement the five aggregates as the summary of the noble truth of suffering. Where the aggregates focus on the functional structure of experience as basis for views of self, the emphasis here is on how sense experience stimulates desire. Despite this difference in orientation, the two collections share much in common, and often the exact same template is applied in both cases. The six sense fields are the means through which the world is known, and so each of them has an “inner” and an “outer” aspect—the “eye” and “sights”, etc. Though common, it’s best to avoid thinking of the external sense field as the “object”, since in the suttas they are depicted in relation to the observing mind, and not as independently existing entities. This is straightforward until we come to the last sense, the “mind” and “thoughts” or “mental phenomena”. Just to clear up a possible confusion, this “sixth sense” is simply the mental faculty, and has nothing to do with psychic powers. The outer aspect is <i>dhammā</i>, a term so ambiguous its translation is always difficult. Here it refers to anything that may be known directly by the mind, distinct from the six senses. The most technically correct translation is probably “mental phenomena”, but “thought’ may be used as a more colloquial rendering, so long as it includes ideas, imagination, and so on, not just verbalized cognition.

## SN 36: Linked Discourses on Feelings

The “Linked Discourses on Feelings” contains 31 discourses on the three kinds of feeling. In Sinhalese-script manuscripts, this is reckoned as the last portion of the section on six sense fields. The term “feelings” renders <i>vedanā</i>, which is the simple affective or hedonic tone of experience as pleasant, painful, and neutral, rather than the complex states we call “emotions”. In the process of experience, feeling emerges from sense contact, and stimulates craving. One of the aims of mental development is to first loosen, then eliminate that second link, so that one still has feelings, but does not experience craving for them. The current collection includes a number of rich and significant discourses on this theme.

## SN 37: Linked Discourses on Females

The “Linked Discourses on Females” contains 34 discourses regarding various qualities of women. Note that the Pali texts use two distinct terms for women, <i>itthī</i> and <i>mātugāma</i>, the latter of which can be translated as “females”. These texts deal with such themes as the kinds of suffering unique to women, why women are reborn in various states, or the qualities that lead to a woman taking charge in her marriage.

## SN 38: Linked Discourses with Jambukhādaka

The “Linked Discourses with Jambukhādaka” contains 16 discourses recording the answers given by Sāriputta to the questions of a wanderer named Jambukhādaka. The questions cover a wide range of themes, from the nature of extinguishment to the difficulty of practicing the Dhamma. This chapter is practically identical to the next, differing only in the name of the wanderer.

## SN 39: Linked Discourses with Sāmaṇḍaka

The “Linked Discourses with Sāmaṇḍaka” contains 16 discourses recording the answers given by Sāriputta to the questions of a wanderer named Sāmaṇḍaka. The questions cover a wide range of themes, from the nature of extinguishment to the difficulty of practicing the Dhamma. This chapter is practically identical to the previous, differing only in the name of the wanderer, and the Pali editions abbreviate, instructing that it is to be expanded.

## SN 40: Linked Discourses with Moggallāna

The “Linked Discourses with Moggallāna” contains 11 discourses featuring Moggallāna, one of the chief disciples. He tells the monks of his struggles in meditation, and how he was encouraged by the Buddha. In the last two discourses, he visit the heavens and teaches the gods.

## SN 41: Linked Discourses with Citta

The “Linked Discourses with Citta” contains 10 discourses featuring the householder Citta, who was praised by the Buddha as the foremost lay disciple in speaking on the Dhamma. Here he engages in a series of insightful and sharp-witted dialogues with various monks. Citta emerges as a distinctive personality, knowledgeable and witty, curious and incisive, with no lack of humor. But he is more than just a clever speaker, for he also lays claim to exalted meditation and spiritual attainments.

## SN 42: Linked Discourses with Chiefs

The “Linked Discourses with Chiefs” contains 13 discourses featuring various headmen or chiefs. They sometimes ask questions relating to their professions, from entertainers to warriors, while several discourses touch on familiar Dhamma themes, such as overcoming anger, the validity of brahmanical rites, or whether monastics should use money. Some of the chiefs are quite adversarial, aiming to trip up the Buddha in debate, or accusing him of being a magician. In the end, though, the Buddha’s compassionate and measured responses win them over.

## SN 43: Linked Discourses on the Unconditioned

The “Linked Discourses on the Unconditioned” contains 44 discourses on the theme of the unconditioned, i.e. <i>nibbāna</i> or “extinguishment”. They focus on the various practices that lead to the unconditioned. This chapter includes an extensive range of terms and idioms describing the final goal of Buddhist practice.

## SN 44: Linked Discourses on the Undeclared

The “Linked Discourses on the Undeclared” contains 44 discourses on the theme of the ten “undeclared” questions. These are a stock series of metaphysical hypotheses, which the Buddha dismissed as being based on the implicit assumption of a self, and hence as being counterproductive to liberation. The first discourse here features a conversation between King Pasenadi and the nun Khemā on this topic.

## sn-mahavaggasamyutta: Book of the Six Sense Fields

The “Book of the Six Sense Fields” is the last and largest of the five books of the Linked Discourses. It consists of twelve <i>saṁyuttas</i>, almost all of which deal with an aspect of Buddhist practice, or the path. The first of these, indeed, is the “Section on the Path” (<i>Maggasaṁyutta</i>), and in the northern canons the book as a whole is referred to as the “Book of the Path” (<i>Maggavagga</i>). The first seven of the <i>saṁyuttas</i> treat the familiar set of seven groups of factors on Buddhist practice known to the later traditions as the <i>bodhipakkhiyā dhammā</i>, or “qualities leading to awakening”. This book is the primary source for these teachings. Subsequent <i>saṁyuttas</i> deal with the path from different perspectives, while the final two deal with stream-entry and the four noble truths respectively.

## SN 45: Linked Discourses on the Path

The “Linked Discourses on the Path” contains 180 discourses on the noble eightfold path, the “middle way” which is the first and most important of all the Buddha’s teachings on the path of spiritual practice. It is mentioned in the first discourse as the fourth noble truth. It begins with “right view” which is initially an accurate conceptual understanding, based on hearing the teachings and reflecting on their meaning. The second factor is right intention, referring to the attitude or motivation that shapes practice. Next come three factors dealing with ethical conduct. And the final three factors directly deal with meditation. Once all these factors are mature, “right immersion” or the four absorptions (<i>jhānas</i>) enables the initial conceptual understanding to ascend to a higher level of insight and letting go. While this and subsequent chapters contains many substantive discourses on this theme, the large number of discourses is mainly attributable to the formulaic “repetition series” which append each chapter.

## SN 46: Linked Discourses on the Awakening Factors

The “Linked Discourses on the Awakening Factors” contains 184 discourses on the seven awakening factors. These are qualities such as mindfulness and investigation which lead the meditator to awakening. The focus here is specifically on meditation, rather than the more holistic approach included in the previous chapter on the Path. Some distinctive features of this collection include the use recitation of the awakening factors in order to inspire those who are sick, and the frequent contrast between the seven awakening factors and the five hindrances.

## SN 47: Linked Discourses on Mindfulness Meditation

The “Linked Discourses on Mindfulness Meditation” contains 104 discourses on the four kinds of mindfulness meditation (<i>satipaṭṭhāna</i>, otherwise known as the “foundations of mindfulness” or “establishments of mindfulness”). These are the body, feelings, mind, and principles. The last of these is translated in various ways, but a close reading of the texts in this chapter shows that it originally referred to the “principles” of causality underlying the process of meditation itself. These discourses on this fundamental topic are much less known than the longer “Discourse on Mindfulness Meditation” found in versions in MN 10 and DN 22; however, they are historically earlier than that late compilation. Where MN 10 emphasizes insight meditation, in this collection we frequently find mindfulness closely connected to absorption, as it is the factor of the path that leads directly to “right immersion”. Insight is mentioned only rarely. The root meaning of the term mindfulness (<i>sati</i>) is “memory”, and when used in meditation it refers to not “forgetting” one’s meditation, but keeping focus on the breath or other theme of meditation. This collection presents a range of perspectives on mindfulness meditation; one of its most memorable features is a series of similes or parables illustrating the practice. The partner of mindfulness (<i>sati</i>) is “situational awareness” (<i>sampajañña</i>, sometimes rendered as “clear comprehension”), which refers to keeping a broad awareness and understanding especially in daily activities.

## SN 48: Linked Discourses on the Faculties

The “Linked Discourses on the Faculties” contains 178 discourses on various sets of “faculties” (<i>indriya</i>). The “five faculties” of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom are the most natural fit in this context. However the chapter also finds room for discourses on a wider range of 22 faculties, including the six sense faculties, five affective faculties (kinds of feeling), three faculties relating the process of enlightenment, and three concerning biology and gender. This flexible category thus serves as a link between the teachings on wisdom and those on the path.

## SN 49: Linked Discourses on the Right Efforts

The “Linked Discourses on the Right Efforts” contains 54 discourses, which are, however, a mere instantiation of the standard repetition series as applied to the four right efforts. There are many discourses on right effort throughout the Pali <i>nikāyas</i>, but for some reason the redactors did not collect them here.

## SN 50: Linked Discourses on the Five Powers

The “Linked Discourses on the Five Powers” contains 108 discourses, which are, however, a mere instantiation of the standard repetition series as applied to the five powers. These powers are effectively identical with the five faculties, as stated at SN 48.43, being merely distinguished as a different teaching approach. There are several discourses on these qualities found mainly in the Aṅguttara Fives, but for some reason the redactors did not collect them here.

## SN 51: Linked Discourses on the Bases of Psychic Power

The “Linked Discourses on the Bases of Psychic Power” contains 86 discourses dealing with the qualities of enthusiasm or desire for practice, energy, higher consciousness, and inquiry, which are said to lead to the development of various psychic powers. The purpose of Buddhism, of course, is not to develop such powers. But they are a matter of constant interest and intrigue among spiritual practitioners—not just in ancient India—and it seems the Buddha formulated this approach to the path to inspire those interested in them. The emphasis is on the development of deep meditation immersion (<i>samādhi</i>) through applying effort.

## SN 52: Linked Discourses with Anuruddha

The “Linked Discourses with Anuruddha” contains 24 discourses with Anuruddha, famous for his powers of clairvoyance, but here revealed as an exponent of mindfulness meditation. It is to mindfulness meditation that he attributes his spiritual attainments, whether psychic powers, absorptions, or awakening. This series of texts can be regarded as a supplement to SN 47.

## SN 53: Linked Discourses on Absorption

The “Linked Discourses on Absorption” contains 54 discourses on the topic of absorption meditation (<i>jhāna</i>), which however merely apply the standard repetition series to the formula for the four absorptions.

## SN 54: Linked Discourses on Breath Meditation

The “Linked Discourses on Breath Meditation” contains 20 discourses on breath meditation (<i>ānāpānassati</i>), the most revered form of meditation from early Buddhism until the present day. It was practiced by the Buddha himself. The meditation is taught in a detailed series of sixteen steps. These are partially sequential, but also overlap in some cases. The development of these fulfills all four kinds of mindfulness meditation and the seven factors of awakening. Thus this one form of meditation can lead to awakening; which is not, however, to say that it is invariably the best approach. The Buddha taught many different meditations for a reason; each has its own qualities and benefits. Breath meditation is seen as a peaceful and pleasant meditation which helps still distracting thoughts. It is a simple practice broadly suitable for most meditators, but leading to profound depths.

## SN 55: Linked Discourses on Stream-Entry

The “Linked Discourses on Stream-Entry” contains 74 discourses on the topic of stream-entry, or more precisely, two sets of four qualities, one of which distinguishes a person as a stream-enterer, and one which help lead to stream-entry. The primary qualities of the first set are faith and ethical conduct. For the second, it is hearing the teaching and practicing accordingly. Note that these sets do not exhaust the qualities of a stream-enterer, many others of which are described elsewhere, but serve to emphasis the crucial role especially of faith.

## SN 56: Linked Discourses on the Truths

The “Linked Discourses on the Truths” contains 131 discourses on the four noble truths: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. These formed the main subject of the Buddha’s first discourse, which is included here as SN 56.11. The Buddha said that all of his teaching was comprised within the four noble truths. Indeed, the overall structure of the main doctrinal Saṁyuttas can be seen as an expanded example of this: The sections on the Aggregates and the Sense Fields deal with the first noble truth; Dependent Origination deals with the second and third; and the chapters on the Path deal with the final truth. This chapter thus provides an overall perspective on the other teachings, and the chapter occurs at the end just as the realization of the four noble truths emerges from the path.
