# The Linked Discourses: the blueprint for Buddhist philosophy

The Saṁyutta Nikāya is the third of the four main divisions in the Sutta Piṭaka of the Pali Canon (*tipiṭaka*). It is translated here as <cite>Linked Discourses</cite>, and is sometimes known as the <cite>Connected Discourses</cite>. As the title suggests, its discourses are grouped thematically. These thematic groups of texts are called *saṁyuttas*, and the Saṁyutta Nikāya is the collection of such *saṁyuttas*.

The Saṁyutta Nikāya consists of 56 *saṁyuttas* collected in five large “books” (*vagga*), containing over a thousand discourses. The Mahāsaṅgīti text as used on SuttaCentral contains 2837 discourses; but the total number of discourses is somewhat arbitrary, as it depends on how the abbreviated texts are expanded, and this differs in different editions. This variation, however, applies only to the way the texts are counted, and does not affect the content, which is almost identical in every edition.

It is in the Saṁyutta Nikāya that we find the core doctrines that have formed the basis for all subsequent Buddhist philosophy. While the text itself does not spell out its organizational principles, the major doctrinal sections correspond with the template of the four noble truths.

1. Suffering
  - Aggregates (SN 22)
  - Six sense media (SN 35)
2. The origin of suffering
  - Dependent origination (SN 12)
3. The cessation of suffering
  - The unconditioned (SN 43)
4. The practice that leads to the end of suffering
  - The chapters of the final book, the Mahāvagga (SN 45–54)

The four noble truths themselves are treated in the final chapter, the Saccasaṁyutta (SN 56).

Not all the *saṁyuttas* fit so easily into this scheme. There are many minor *saṁyuttas*, which are sometimes connected with a major *saṁyutta*, and sometimes are independent. In addition, the first book, the Sagāthāvagga, is not organized by subject. Rather, the thematic linking here is the type of person involved in the discourse. These texts are also unified in literary form; they are in mixed prose and verse.

This collection has a full parallel in the Saṁyuktāgama (SA) of the Sarvāstivāda school in Chinese translation. In addition, there are two partial collections in Chinese (SA-2 and SA-3) as well as a number of miscellaneous or fragmentary texts in Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan. Much of the organizational structure of SN is shared with SA, suggesting that this structure preceded the split between these two collections.

## How the Saṁyutta is Organized

The Saṁyutta Nikāya is conveniently divided into five large *vaggas* or “books”. As noted in the General Introduction, the Saṁyutta is an example of the “nested *vagga*” structure, where the (unusual) *vagga* as “book” includes many of the normal kind of “small” *vagga*, i.e. groups of about ten suttas.

Within each of the five “big” *vaggas* there are several *saṁyuttas*, each containing a set of discourses that are linked by theme or person (sometimes both). For example, each of the discourses in SN 5 features a nun (*bhikkhunī*), while each discourse in SN 24 deals with the subject of “views” (*diṭṭhi*).

In SuttaCentral, the discourses of the Saṁyutta are referenced by *saṁyutta* and *sutta*. Thus SN 1.1 is the first discourse of the first *saṁyutta*, while SN 56.11 is the eleventh discourse of the fifty-sixth *saṁyutta*. The SC system is  is the same as that used by Bhikkhu Bodhi and on Access to Insight.

You may encounter various other referencing systems. In modern academic works, texts are often referenced by volume and page of the Pali Text Society edition of the original Pali. This is a regrettable and unscientific convention, and I hope it is soon abandoned in favor of proper semantic references. The PTS numbers are displayed on SC in the sutta cards.

Traditionally, the texts were—and indeed still are—referenced the long way: by *nikāya*, *vagga*, *saṁyutta*, *paṇṇasaka* (for the Khandha Saṁyutta and Saḷāyatana Saṁyutta), *vagga* and *sutta*. This system is helpful when using manuscripts, as you can narrow your search step by step through the manuscript to find what you need. On the web, or even in books, however, it is unnecessary. Nevertheless, you can use the traditional navigation structure in our sidebar if you wish.

The five books are named according to various principles:

- Vol. 1 Sagāthāvagga contains sets of discourses that contain verses, as indicated by the title.
- Vols. 2–4 are each named after the first and largest *saṁyutta* of the book.
- Vol. 5 is called the “Great Book” due to its size.

In this Introduction I will give an overview of each of the five books. However, I will not summarize each of the 56 *saṁyuttas*, for that would make the introduction far too long. For such summaries, see the lists of suttas on SuttaCentral, which include explanations of the various structural levels of the *saṁyutta*, as well as each individual discourse.

## The Book With Verses

The “Book With Verses” is divided into eleven <i>saṁyuttas</i>, with a total of 271 suttas.

Where most of the Saṁyutta is organized around subject matter, here the organizational principle is people. Each <i>saṁyutta</i> contains conversation involving the Buddha or his disciples with a different person or kind of person, such as gods, kings, nuns, or brahmins.

A typical sutta has a bare narrative framework, where someone comes to the Buddha and utters a verse, and the Buddha replies with a better one. In some cases, notably the Sakkasaṁyutta, the narrative element is developed into a lively exchange.

Each of the suttas in this collection contains verse with a prose narrative background, although in many cases the prose has been omitted through abbreviation. This kind of literary form is extremely common in Indic literature, so it is worth spending a little time to understand how it works.

The oldest Indic literature is the Ṛg Veda, a collection of about 10,600 verses. These were passed down in the oral tradition for thousands of years. One of the keys to accurate transmission of this sacred lore was the use of metre. Indian verse is always structured according to a certain rhythmic pattern, based on set patterns of long and short syllables. Such metres provide a scaffolding that organize words, and hence knowledge, in a form that is memorable like a song; and indeed, they would have been sung in a simple melody. In this way, the verses become set in a precise and defined form, one that may be preserved and passed down unaltered through the generations.

But poetry is not just technically complex; it is ecstatic, inspired, divine. The brahmins did not see the Vedas as being authored in the normal sense, but channeled as the divine word of god (Brahmā) through human sages (Pali: *isi*; Sanskrit *ṛṣi*). The Vedic verses constantly allude to stories, myths, and events—for example, the saying of the dragon Vṛtra by the god-hero Indra—that were well known to their audience, and thus did not require spelling out in the text itself. The verses are in fact hymns, invoked in ritual to heighten the emotional response, to inspire awe, fear, or devotion. They are given meaning and context by the background understanding of the mythology. Thus the verses imply a story, of which they are the emotional and narrative climax.

Thus a syllable-perfect verse becomes the seed crystal around which a more flexible prose narrative is formed. The prose may be adapted to time and place, presented in greater or lesser detail, adapted for the audience, commenting on contemporary events, or expressing a personal perspective; but the verse is always the same.

In the Book With Verses we see this ancient Vedic pattern adopted to serve a Buddhist purpose. Thus it is no coincidence that here we focus on the various deities, many of whom derive directly from Vedic mythology, and in some cases commenting directly on specific Vedic or brahmanical passages.

The casual appearance of deities throughout these texts is, of course, problematic. These days, we don’t normally see gods manifesting with glorious light at spiritual gatherings. So how are we to understand this?

One obvious answer is that such texts are literally true: gods of these names did appear in exactly the way depicted and have these exact conversations. Okay, but if so, why are such things are not seen in our day? One might be tempted to point regretfully to the decline of religious and ethical life in modern times. But this creates an even bigger problem. For when we see the past as a uniquely privileged era, one blessed with a degree of purity and wholesomeness that is lost to us, then what is the point of practice? Are we not better off pining for the glories of old, and wishing for the renewal of the Dhamma under Metteyya? Such views, which are extremely common in traditional Buddhist cultures, forget a basic principle of the teaching: it is *akāliko*—we can realize it in the here & now.

So perhaps we are better off adopting a skeptical view: such deities do not exist, and such events did not happen. They are simply religious propaganda, fictions whose purpose is to convert simple people by importing a familiar Indic cosmology. If there is any reality at all to them, it is purely psychological. Such beings represent different aspects of the mind. But, despite its scientific appearance, this reductive view, too, is unsustainable. The ideas of rebirth and the existence of multiple dimensions of existence are not found just in popular narratives, but are central to core teachings such as the four noble truths (*yāyaṁ taṇhā ponobbhavikā*) and dependent origination. They can’t be simply written off as Indian culture.

These views are polar opposites; and like all pairs of opposites, they share much more in common than they like to admit. Both of them are concerned with *facts*: the crucial thing about these events is whether they were true or not. But the texts as we have them are not collections of facts; they are stories. And the significance of a story lies in its meaning. Whether a story is real or not is secondary, and often beside the point entirely. It serves a purpose of communicating meaning, engaging an audience, and provoking wonder, surprise, awe, or joy.

The Buddhist traditions understood this well, as evidenced by the textual situation. While in some cases the verses and story are tightly linked, it is very common for the same verse to be accompanied by completely different background narratives, or by no background at all. The verses, which convey the essential Dhamma teaching, the core of meaning and emotion, remain the same, while the story varies. To insist on the factuality or otherwise of the story is to miss the point. The story provides a context that brings the teaching in the verses to life for an audience.

Thus the best lens through which to see such texts is neither as history nor as propaganda but as myth. Each of the short suttas tells a sacred story that conveys an eternal spiritual truth in a way that spoke to the audience of that time and place. They take place within a wider mythology that, through story, helps people find their place in a vast and unknown cosmos.

As always, the early Buddhist response to the earlier religious traditions is complex and nuanced. And, while it is true that many of the details of both literary form and subject matter are drawn from the Vedas, it is in the differences that the distinctively Buddhist character of the texts show themselves.

In the Vedas, the human agents are merely the transmitters of the sacred word of the gods. Exactly how this happened is unclear, but it probably involved a combination of drugs (*soma* is one of the great Vedic deities), ritual, creative inspiration, traditional lore, devotion, and communal empowerment, inspiring the sacred poets to heights of ecstatic visioning through which the words of the gods manifested. But regardless of the details, the key point is that the traditions regarded the human agent in the relationship as distinctly inferior, and the real value of the texts as stemming from the divine.

In the Buddhist texts, the situation is reversed. The gods do not inspire human hosts, they speak for themselves. And they are no infallible reserves of Truth; they may be right or wrong, skillful or foolish, just like anyone else. While the magnificence of their presence is emphasized, the ultimate effect is to show the worthlessness of such displays, for the gods are constantly being schooled by the Buddha. The most characteristic form of dialogue is where a god presents an idea that is pretty good, within in a limited, mundane (i.e. Vedic) world view, but which the Buddha elevates to an entirely new level.

It is an elementary fact of Buddhism that the gods are not metaphysical, in the sense that they do not exist in a separate realm governed by different principles than our own. On the contrary, they are impermanent and suffering, trapped in the cycle of transmigration just like us. It follows from this that they do not have access to any special form of knowledge or wisdom. Buddhists do not look to the gods for teachings; rather, the Buddha is “teacher of gods and humans”.

I have focused on the interactions with divine beings in this collection, as these are the least accessible and most open to misunderstanding. But not all of the collections feature divine beings. Many of the collections feature kinds of people familiar from other texts of the time. And even when divine beings are involved, in the majority of cases, the verses themselves do not require a divine setting, as there's nothing about the gods and their divine dramas in the verses themselves. 

Some of the texts in this collection are well known and widely quoted, such as the invitation of Brahmā or the nun Vajirā’s simile of the person as a chariot. Most of the suttas here have parallels in the Chinese Saṁyukāgama translations; the partial translations SA 2 and SA 3 include Sagāthāvagga material. In addition, many of the verses have parallels elsewhere throughout the Buddhist literature in all languages.

## The Book of Causation

The “Book of Causation” is the second of the five books of the Linked Discourses. It is named after the first and longest <i>saṁyutta</i>, which deals with causation through the core Buddhist teaching of Dependent Origination. The remaining nine <i>saṁyuttas</i> deal with miscellaneous secondary themes, some organized by subject, others by person.

The “Linked Discourses on Causation” is a major collection containing 93 discourses on the core Buddhist teaching of dependent origination. Dependent origination presents a series of conditional links laying bare how suffering originates and how it ends. As such, it is an extended treatment of the second and third noble truths. It integrates psychological and existential aspects of suffering, showing how when bound by attachment we make choices that bind us to transmigrating into future lives. One of the core purposes is to explain how rebirth takes place without having to invoke metaphysical concepts such as a “soul”. The collection begins by defining each of the terms in the standard 12-linked chain, definitions which are assumed to apply throughout. Remaining discourses iterate on this theme, introducing new perspectives and formulations.

## The Book of the Aggregates

The “Book of the Aggregates” is the third of the five books of the Linked Discourses. It is named after the first and longest <i>saṁyutta</i>, which deals with the core Buddhist teaching of the five aggregates. Of the remaining twelve <i>saṁyuttas</i>, three also take up the theme of the aggregates, while the remainder deal with miscellaneous secondary themes, some organized by subject, others by person.

The “Linked Discourses on the Aggregates” contains 159 discourses on the core doctrinal topic of the five aggregates. This term was introduced in the first sermon as the summary of the noble truth of suffering, and became a foundational teaching in all forms of Buddhism. The basic idea of an “aggregate” is a set or class of phenomena. The five are form (<i>rūpa</i>, i.e. “physical phenomena”, or sometimes simply “body”; note that in Buddhism, <i>rūpa</i> includes all things with material properties such as shape and color, including visions perceived only in the mind), feeling (<i>vedanā</i>, i.e. the pleasant, painful, or neutral tone of experience), perception (<i>saññā</i>, i.e. the recognition or interpretation of experience, <em>not</em> sense awareness), choices (<i>saṅkhārā</i>, i.e. intention, will, or volition; the choice to perform an act, especially one with an ethical dimension), and consciousness (<i>vịññāṇa</i>, i.e. the subjective process of awareness itself). The “aggregates” are the various different phenomena so classified. Almost always, they are referred to as the “aggregates connected with grasping” (<i>upādānakkhandha</i>). The relation between “grasping” and “aggregate” encompasses a number of aspects. The aggregates are the <em>subject</em> of grasping, in that they are the things that are normally attached to and taken to be the permanent “self”. But they are not merely passive spectators: they are also the <em>functional support</em> of grasping, the things that make grasping work. As active participants in the process of grasping, they <em>stimulate</em> grasping to themselves (<i>upādāniya</i>). And finally, they are the <em>product</em> of grasping in the sense that attachments in past lives have given rise to the aggregates in this life (<i>upādinna</i>). One of the key functions of the aggregates is to categorize theories of the self. From the discourses, non-Buddhists seem to be familiar with this, yet we cannot identify the aggregates in any pre-Buddhist texts. Regardless of whether the set of categories was pre-Buddhist, the Buddha treated them in his own distinctive way, emphasizing that nothing in the aggregates was a permanent self or soul. In this collection we find a large number of striking and lively narratives, showing how the aggregates could be a solace at the time of death, a guide to the knotty theoretical debates on identity, or a framework for insight meditation. Many of the short abbreviated texts are built from the same templates employed in the “Linked Discourses on the Six Sense Fields”.

## The Book of the Six Sense Fields

The “Book of the Six Sense Fields” is the fourth of the five books of the Linked Discourses. It is named after the first and longest <i>saṁyutta</i>, which deals with the core Buddhist teaching of the six sense fields. The second <i>saṁyutta</i> on Feelings also deals with a major doctrinal topic. The remaining eight <i>saṁyuttas</i> deal with miscellaneous secondary themes, some organized by subject, others by person.

The number of discourses in the “Linked Discourses on the Six Sense Fields” varies between editions, mainly due to the way repetitions are counted; SuttaCentral follows Bhikkhu Bodhi’s translation in counting 248 discourses. The six sense fields complement the five aggregates as the summary of the noble truth of suffering. Where the aggregates focus on the functional structure of experience as basis for views of self, the emphasis here is on how sense experience stimulates desire. Despite this difference in orientation, the two collections share much in common, and often the exact same template is applied in both cases. The six sense fields are the means through which the world is known, and so each of them has an “inner” and an “outer” aspect—the “eye” and “sights”, etc. Though common, it’s best to avoid thinking of the external sense field as the “object”, since in the suttas they are depicted in relation to the observing mind, and not as independently existing entities. This is straightforward until we come to the last sense, the “mind” and “thoughts” or “mental phenomena”. Just to clear up a possible confusion, this “sixth sense” is simply the mental faculty, and has nothing to do with psychic powers. The outer aspect is <i>dhammā</i>, a term so ambiguous its translation is always difficult. Here it refers to anything that may be known directly by the mind, distinct from the six senses. The most technically correct translation is probably “mental phenomena”, but “thought’ may be used as a more colloquial rendering, so long as it includes ideas, imagination, and so on, not just verbalized cognition.

## The Great Book

The “Great Book” is the last and largest of the five books of the Linked Discourses. It consists of twelve <i>saṁyuttas</i>, almost all of which deal with an aspect of Buddhist practice, or the path. The first of these, indeed, is the “Section on the Path” (<i>Maggasaṁyutta</i>), and in the northern canons the book as a whole is referred to as the “Book of the Path” (<i>Maggavagga</i>). The first seven of the <i>saṁyuttas</i> treat the familiar set of seven groups of factors on Buddhist practice known to the later traditions as the <i>bodhipakkhiyā dhammā</i>, or “qualities leading to awakening”. This book is the primary source for these teachings. Subsequent <i>saṁyuttas</i> deal with the path from different perspectives, while the final two deal with stream-entry and the four noble truths respectively.

## A Brief Textual History

The Saṁyutta Nikāya was edited by M. Léon Feer on the basis of manuscripts in Sinhalese and Burmese scripts, and published in Latin script by the Pali Text Society from 1884 to 1898. The first translation followed in 1917–30 by Mrs C.A.F. Rhys Davids (vols. 1–2) and F.L. Woodward (vols. 3–5) under the title <cite>The Book of the Kindred Sayings</cite>. In 1999 the PTS issued a new edition of the Pali text of vol. 1 Sagāthāvagga, edited by G.A. Somaratne.

While several partial translations were subsequently made, there was no complete new translation in English until 2002, when Bhikkhu Bodhi published his <cite>Connected Discourses of the Buddha</cite>. As with his translation of the <cite>Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha</cite>, this constituted a major leap forward, essentially rendering the earlier translation obsolete. Unlike the <cite>Middle Length Discourses</cite>, however, this was an entirely new translation. In an extensive introduction, Bhikkhu Bodhi spelled out his evolving approach to translation and presented a detailed thematic and structural analysis of the text.

Where the Pali was unclear I frequently referred to the earlier work of Bodhi, and rarely to Woodward/Rhys Davids and various translations of specific texts.
