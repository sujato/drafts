# A Reader’s Introduction to the Linked Discourses

The Saṁyutta Nikāya is the third of the four main divisions in the Sutta Piṭaka of the Pali Canon (*tipiṭaka*). It is translated here as <cite>Linked Discourses</cite>, and is sometimes known as the <cite>Connected Discourses</cite>. As the title suggests, its discourses are grouped thematically. These thematic groups of texts are called *saṁyuttas*, and the Saṁyutta Nikāya is the collection of such *saṁyuttas*.

It is in the Saṁyutta Nikāya that we find the core doctrines that have formed the basis for all subsequent Buddhist philosophy. While the text itself does not spell out its organizational principles, the major doctrinal sections correspond with the template of the four noble truths.

1. Suffering
  - Aggregates (SN 22)
  - Six sense media (SN 35)
2. The origin of suffering
  - Dependent origination (SN 12)
3. The cessation of suffering
  - The unconditioned (SN 43)
4. The practice that leads to the end of suffering
  - The chapters of the final book, the Mahāvagga (SN 45–54)

The four noble truths themselves are treated in the final chapter, the Saccasaṁyutta (SN 56).

Not all the *saṁyuttas* fit so easily into this scheme. There are many minor *saṁyuttas*, which are sometimes connected with a major *saṁyutta*, and sometimes are independent. In addition, the first book, the Sagathāvagga, is not organized by subject. Rather, the thematic linking here is the type of person involved in the discourse. These texts are also unified in literary form; they are in mixed prose and verse.
