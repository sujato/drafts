# A General Introduction to the Pali Nikāyas

The four main *nikāyas* of the Pali canon (Tipiṭaka) are the core texts for any understanding of early Buddhism. They consist of roughly 1,000,000 words, preserved and passed down by the Buddhist traditions as the word of the Buddha.

The four *nikāyas* are contained in the traditional structure of the Pali Tipiṭaka, or “Three Baskets”.

- Vinaya Piṭaka (Basket of Monastic Law)
- Sutta Piṭaka (Basket of Discourses)
  - **Dīgha Nikāya** (Long Discourses)
  - **Majjhima Nikāya** (Middle Discourses)
  - **Saṁyutta Nikāya** (Linked Discourses)
  - **Aṅguttara Nikāya** (Numbered Discourses)
  - Khuddaka Nikāya (Minor Discourses)
- Abhidhamma Piṭaka (Basket of Systematc Treatises)

Similar collections exist in ancient Chinese translations, and substantial parts of them are found in Sanskrit and Tibetan. SuttaCentral hosts almost all of these texts and provides comprehensive parallels that show the connections between them. A comparative understanding of the full range of texts is essential for a serious study of early Buddhism.

There are many reasons, though, why the Pali texts will always retain a special place for those who wish to understand what the Buddha taught:

- They are the only scriptures which we possess in full in an early Indic dialect.
- They are accompanied by an extensive and detailed set of ancient commentaries (*aṭṭhakathā*).
- They are the central scriptures of a living tradition, the Theravāda school found in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam.
- They are, for the most part, linguistically clear, well-edited, and highly readable.

For these reasons the Pali texts have been translated multiple times, and they form the main basis for understanding of early Buddhism.

And among the Pali texts, it is the four *nikāyas* that command the most attention. It is there that we find extensive and definitive explanations of Buddhist teachings, as well as the living personality of the Buddha and his immediate disciples.

By comparison, the <cite>Vinaya Piṭaka</cite> is primarily of interest for understanding the monastic communities, as well as providing much information about the history and social background. But it contains only limited doctrinal content. The <cite>Abhidhamma Piṭaka</cite> is highly specialized and somewhat later. And the books of the Khuddaka Nikāya are very mixed. Some fairly short books are (mostly verse) supplements to the main four *nikāyas* (the Dhammapada, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Sutta Nipāta, Theragāthā, and Therīgāthā). However, most of the books in this collection are later, and depict a phase of Buddhism a few centuries after the Buddha.

So  the four *nikāyas*  are the starting point for an understanding of the Buddha’s teachings. The purpose of these introductions is to give the reader enough background to get oriented among these texts.

Note, however, that I will avoid going into the doctrines in any depth. I admit I have reservations about the usefulness of summaries. There have been plenty of attempts at summarizing the doctrines of the early texts that are quite fine as far as summaries go. But the true joy of the suttas is in the undigested teachings, in that raw moment when the Buddha encounters a person in suffering and helps them, not by giving them a digested abstract, but by reaching out to them as people. I feel that it’s better to let a general understanding of the teachings emerge from such moments, rather than setting it as a precondition.

In this general introduction I will give an overview, aiming to ease a student into reading the suttas by addressing many of the questions that they may have. I avoid giving too many examples, as it could easily become very long. Rather, the general information presented here is fleshed out in individual essays on each of the four *nikāyas*, which should be read after this essay.

<aside>Among students of the suttas, the names of these collections are often abbreviated to “Dīgha”, “Majjhima”, and so on, just as the word “Sutta” is often omitted from sutta titles. Strictly speaking, it’d be best to use the Pali title when referring to the original text, and the translated title when referring to the translation; but this distinction is often overlooked.</aside>

## Finding Your Way

The Buddha’s teaching is a graduated one, leading from simple principles to profound realizations. This pattern is observed in almost all of the discourses in one way or another. However it does <em>not</em> apply to the collections of discourses. From collection to collection or discourse to discourse there is no graduation in difficulty, no build up of assumed knowledge in the student.  

On the contrary, the Dīgha Nikāya begins with the Brahmajala Sutta, while the Majjhima Nikāya begins with the Mūlapariyāya Sutta, both of which are among the most profound and difficult discourses in the whole canon. A student who dives in unwarily will suddenly find themselves in very deep waters.

So if you wish to build up your knowledge step by step, you can’t rely on simply reading the suttas in order. We provide a number of reading guides that might help you with this. In addition, we provide “difficulty” icons for the discourses of the Majjhima and the Dīgha: a new sprout for beginners, a sapling for intermediate students, and a flourishing tree for advanced students.

Having said which, there’s nothing wrong with simply plunging in at random, so long as you don’t expect everything to make sense at first. Usually you’ll find that obscure or difficult ideas are explained somewhere else in the suttas. Discovering those unexpected connections is one of the joys of reading the suttas.

As students of Buddhist texts we are interested in the content, in learning what the Buddha and his disciples had to say. However, due to the manner in which the texts are arranged, we quickly discover that it’s not easy to find what we want, or to know how different texts relate to each other. So while it may seem dry, it is worth spending a little time to consider the <em>structure</em> of the texts.

Early Buddhist texts were organized, not for reading, but for oral recitation and memorization. The overriding concern was to divide the texts into chunks that could be memorized and recited together. Since the texts were preserved in memory, they were largely “random access”: a skilled student could instantly recall a passage from anywhere in the texts, without having to flip through the pages or look up an index. In this way, the earliest system of organization is a little similar to how we find information today through a search engine.

It follows from this that we cannot expect early Buddhist texts to be structured sequentially like a modern book. But the collections are not random or chaotic: they follow their own logic and principles, which we can readily understand.

## Elements of Structure

Here are some of the structural or formal elements you will encounter in the early Buddhist texts. Pali texts use a large number of terms for textual levels, which only very roughly map onto English concepts such as “chapter” or “collection”. But I supply approximate translations.

## Imagery and Narrative

The suttas frequently employ an ABA pattern. A statement is made; a simile is given; and the statement is repeated. This formal pattern is highly effective in reinforcing learning. First we get the basic idea. But abstract philosophical or psychological statements are hard to understand and remember without any context. So the Buddha illuminates his teaching with a simile. The range of similes in the suttas is truly astounding. The Buddha was able to effortlessly summon an apt comparison from anything that he saw around him. The similes also convey a great deal of incidental detail regarding life and culture in the Buddha’s day, and, more importantly, they show how the Dhamma teaching makes sense in its context.

Sometimes the similes are extended to a brief parable or fable. Curiously enough, however, we rarely see the Buddha engage in story-telling of any length.

Where narratives are developed in some detail, they are typically as part of the background story (<i>nidāna</i>) rather than in the Buddha’s teaching as such. It is an elementary principle of historical scholarship that the background story is of a somewhat later date than the main doctrinal material. Such stories vary considerably in the parallels, showing that the traditions treated them more flexibly than the doctrines.

### Repetition

It won't take long before you notice that the suttas tend to be repetitious. <em>Very</em> repetitious. This is a major hurdle for a new reader.

The repetitions are <em>fractal</em> in nature. That is, they occur at every level of the text: the word, the phrase, the sentence, the paragraph, the passage, the whole text, even the group of texts. This feature shows that the repetition is not something alien to these texts, not something forced on them by an over-zealous editor, but is intrinsic from the beginning.

But why? The key is that the texts were formed in an oral tradition. And in an oral tradition, repetition works very differently than it does in writing. When you read a repetition, it often feels annoying; it feels like a waste of time, and you want to skip over it. But when reciting, repetition has exactly the opposite effect. It is soothing and relaxing. The parts that are different take more work, you have to exercise your memory more; but then when it comes to the repeated passage—like the chorus of a song—you relax and go with it. Repetitions give the reciter space to be at ease and contemplate. Reciting a highly repetitive text becomes a form of meditation, where you contemplate the meaning and apply it to your experience as you recite.

But in addition to this spiritual aspect, repetition has a definite practical purpose: preservation. By saying the same thing again and again, identically or in small variations, the reciters were constantly checking their memories, ensuring the correctness of the texts. And if a text was lost, there is always another similar passage somewhere else. Thus the repetitions ensured the long-term survival of the Dhamma by creating backups of important information in multiple places, retained in the minds of the Buddhist practitioners.

Understanding the historical role of repetitions, however, doesn't help us when we just want to read a sutta. What are we to do? Well, there isn't a single answer, any more than there is a single way to read a text. Some people prefer to read them in full, contemplating each repetition. Others read them more briefly, getting to the important point. You'll figure out a way that suits you. But when you understand the role of repetitions, hopefully you will not find them such an obstruction.

### Abbreviation

The flipside of repetition is abbreviation. Since the repetitions are so abundant, they are often abbreviated. Such abbreviation is not a modern invention: it is found throughout the manuscripts. No edition fully spells out all the repetitions.

Generally speaking, the abbreviations as found in the Pali editions, and the occasional instructions on how to spell out the full text, are sensible and fairly consistent between editions. Modern translations follow the manuscript tradition, but not slavishly. Sometimes the translation will spell out abbreviated passages, or else abbreviate passages spelled out in the original.

Abbreviations are both "internal"—for example, where the only the first and last items in a list are spelled out, and the rest just mentioned in brief—and "external", where an abbreviated passage requires looking up another text to fill in the blanks. This is another example of how the oral tradition differs from written texts. A reciter would obviously know, say, the formula for the four noble truths, so there is no need to write it every time; just enough to jog the memory. But in modern editions, especially on the web, a reader can access a specific text from anywhere, and may never have encountered the abbreviated passage before. So we try to present our translations so as to reduce the amount of external abbreviations, so far as is practicable.

### Titles

Buddhist manuscripts rarely if ever have titles at the start like modern texts. Rather, the title is recorded at the end. In modern editions, these titles have been added at the start for clarity.

In many cases, especially in the titles of suttas and <i>vaggas</i>, what we actually have in the manuscript is not really a title as such, but a key word found in the summary verse (*uddāna*) found at the end of a <i>vagga</i> or other division. These verses were inserted by the redactors of the canon in order to help keep the contents organized, much like a Table of Contents. However, the verses do vary to some extent between editions, so the titles of suttas are not always consistent. In addition, some suttas are assigned more than one title in the text itself (see DN 1 <cite>Brahmajala</cite>), or there are spelling variations. So take care, for it is quite common to find different titles for the same text.

### Textual Divisions

#### Vagga (“Chapter”)

The <i>vagga</i> is the most widespread and distinctive structural unit in early Buddhist texts. It usually consists of ten textual units, which may be ten discourses, ten verses, ten rules, and so on. The number ten is adhered to fairly consistently, although on occasion a <i>vagga</i> may contain more or less than ten. This happens in the second-last <i>vagga</i> of the Majjhima, which contains twelve discourses.

Like the <i>paṇṇāsa</i>, the <i>vagga</i> is often no more than a division to help organize the discourses neatly. In such cases, a <i>vagga</i> is usually just named after its first discourse. However, it is also common to find that a <i>vagga</i> collects discourses with a loose thematic unity. For example, in the Dīgha Nikāya the <cite>Sīlakkhandhavagga</cite> (thirteen discourses in this case) all deal with the “gradual training” of ethics, meditation, and wisdom.

In some cases, a *vagga* in Pali may parallel a similar *vagga* in another language. For example, the famous <cite>Aṭṭhakavagga</cite> of the Sutta Nipāta exists in Chinese translation, though the Sutta Nipāta as a whole does not. Similarly, the <cite>Sīlakkhandhavagga</cite> of the Dīgha Nikāya has parallels in both the Dharmaguptaka (Chinese) and Sarvāstivāda (Sanskrit) texts of the Dīgha.

Occasionally the word <i>vagga</i> is applied to a larger textual unit, one that includes a number of sections, each of which composed of “little” <i>vaggas</i>. Examples of such nested *vagga* structures include the Saṁyutta Nikāya and the Khandhakas of the Pali Vinaya.

#### Paṇṇāsa (“Fifty”)

The word <i>paṇṇāsa</i> means “fifty”, and it is a group of approximately fifty suttas, or five vaggas. It is used to organize collections that contain many vaggas. The <i>paṇṇāsa</i> is purely for convenience, and does not correspond to any meaningful divisions of the text.

#### Nipāta (“Group”)

The literal meaning of <i>nipāta</i> is “fallen down”, and it is a generic term for texts that have been placed together. In the Aṅguttara, it is used for each division of texts gathered together by number: the groups of discourses consisting of one item, and so on. Elsewhere it is used, for example, in the title of the Sutta Nipāta, the “Group of Discourses”.

#### Saṁyutta (“Collection of Linked Discourses”)

Whereas the *nipāta* is quite generic, the *saṃyutta* has a more specific meaning: texts collected according to a similar theme or subject matter. The Saṁyutta Nikāya consists of 52 such collections.

#### Nikāya or Āgama (“Division”)

The largest structural unit, usually known as *nikāya* in the Pali tradition of the Theravāda, and as *āgama* in the northern traditions. However, the term *āgama*, while it has fallen into disuse in modern Theravāda, is found quite commonly in the Pali commentaries.

The four *nikāyas* as found in the Pali seem to have been fairly standard and similar collections are, so far as we know, found in all the other schools. However, while the overall nature of the collections is similar, and they are organized in similar ways, the detailed content varies considerably. It frequently happens that a sutta found in the Majjhima of one school, for example, may be found in the Saṁyutta or Dīgha of another school. In addition, the internal sequence of texts is quite different. It seems the *nikāyas* were conceived more as organizational guidelines than as fixed units.

The fifth Pali *nikāya*, the Khuddaka Nikāya, is more flexible and varies more between traditions. It seems it originated as a place for collecting verses and minor texts not gathered elsewhere. However the Pali collection became a handy place to include later texts. While there are occasional references to a similar collection in the northern schools, none exist in that form today. Nevertheless, many of the individual texts of the Khuddaka have parallels, with the Dhammapada especially existing in many different editions.
