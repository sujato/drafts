Among students of the suttas, the names of these collections are often abbreviated to “Dīgha”, “Majjhima”, and so on, just as the word “Sutta” is often omitted from sutta titles. Strictly speaking, it’d be best to use the Pali title when referring to the original text, and the translated title when referring to the translation, but this distinction is often overlooked.

Note, however, that I will avoid going into the doctrines in any depth. This is mainly because the teachings of the four <i>nikāyas</i> are highly consistent and interrelated and are best seen as a whole.

But it’s also because I have reservations about the usefulness of summaries. There have been plenty of attempts at summarizing the doctrines of the early texts that are quite fine as far as summaries go. But the true joy of the suttas is to see the undigested teachings, the raw moment when the Buddha encounters a person in suffering and helps them, not by giving them a digested abstract, but by reaching out to them as people. I feel that it’s better to let a general understanding of the teachings emerge from such moments, rather than setting it as a precondition. Thus the purpose of this introduction is not to condition your expectations of what the Buddha taught, but to give some background information and orientation.

### Finding Your Way

The Buddha’s teaching is a graduated one, leading from simple principles to profound realizations. This pattern is observed in almost all of the discourses in one way or another. However it does <em>not</em> apply to the collections of discourses. From discourse to discourse there is no graduation in difficulty, no build up of assumed knowledge in the student.  

On the contrary, the Dīgha Nikāya begins with the Brahmajala Sutta, while the Majjhima Nikāya begins with the Mūlapariyāya Sutta, both of which are among the most profound and difficult discourses in the whole canon. A student who dives in unwarily will suddenly find themselves in very deep waters.

So if a beginning student wishes to build up their foundations of knowledge step by step, they can’t rely on simply reading the suttas in order. It’s best to start with a structured reading guide, hopefully with an experienced teacher. As a small help, we provide “difficulty” icons for the discourses of the Majjhima and the Dīgha: a new sprout for beginners, a sapling for intermediate students, and a flourishing tree for advanced students.

Having said which, there’s nothing wrong with simply plunging in at random, so long as you don’t expect everything to make sense at first. Usually you’ll find that obscure or difficult ideas are explained somewhere else in the suttas. Discovering those unexpected connections is one of the joys of reading the suttas.

As students of Buddhist texts we are interested in the content, in learning what the Buddha and his disciples had to say. However, due to the manner in which the texts are arranged, we quickly discover that it’s not easy to find what we want, or to know how different texts relate to each other. So while it may seem dry, it is worth spending a little time to consider the <em>structure</em> of the texts.

Early Buddhist texts were organized, not for reading, but for oral recitation and memorization. The overriding concern was to divide the texts into chunks that could be memorized and recited together. Since the texts were preserved in memory, they were largely “random access”: a skilled student could instantly recall a passage from anywhere in the texts, without having to flip through the pages or look up an index. In this way, the earliest system of organization is a little similar to how we find information today through a search engine.

It follows from this that we cannot expect early Buddhist texts to be structured sequentially like a modern book. But the collections are not random or chaotic: they follow their own logic and principles, which we can readily understand.

## Elements of Structure

Here are some of the structural elements that are encountered in the early Buddhist texts. Pali texts use a large number of terms for textual levels, which only very roughly map onto English concepts such as “chapter” or “collection”. But I supply approximate translations.

### Titles

Buddhist manuscripts rarely if ever have titles at the start like modern texts. Rather, the title is recorded at the end. In modern editions, these titles have been added at the start for clarity.

In many cases, especially in the titles of suttas and <i>vaggas</i>, what we actually have in the manuscript is not really a title as such, but a key word found in the summary verse (*uddāna*) found at the end of a <i>vagga</i> or other division. These verses were inserted by the redactors of the canon in order to help keep the contents organized, much like a Table of Contents. However, the verses do vary to some extent between editions, so the titles of suttas are not always consistent. In addition, some suttas are assigned more than one title in the text itself (see DN 1 <cite>Brahmajala</cite>), or there are spelling variations. So take care, for it is quite common to find different titles for the same text.

### Vagga (“Chapter”)

The <i>vagga</i> is the most widespread and distinctive structural unit in early Buddhist texts. It usually consists of ten textual units, which may be ten discourses, ten verses, ten rules, and so on. The number ten is adhered to fairly consistently, although on occasion a <i>vagga</i> may contain more or less than ten. This happens in the second-last <i>vagga</i> of the Majjhima, which contains twelve discourses.

Like the <i>paṇṇāsa</i>, the <i>vagga</i> is often no more than a division to help organize the discourses neatly. In such cases, a <i>vagga</i> is usually just named after its first discourse. However, it is also common to find that a <i>vagga</i> collects discourses with a loose thematic unity. For example, in the Dīgha Nikāya the <cite>Sīlakkhandhavagga</cite> (thirteen discourses in this case) all deal with the “gradual training” of ethics, meditation, and wisdom.

In some cases, a *vagga* in Pali may parallel a similar *vagga* in another language. For example, the famous <cite>Aṭṭhakavagga</cite> of the Sutta Nipāta exists in Chinese translation, though the Sutta Nipāta as a whole does not. Similarly, the <cite>Sīlakkhandhavagga</cite> of the Dīgha Nikāya has parallels in both the Dharmaguptaka (Chinese) and Sarvāstivāda (Sanskrit) texts of the Dīgha.

Occasionally the word <i>vagga</i> is applied to a larger textual unit, one that includes a number of sections, each of which composed of "little" <i>vaggas</i>. Examples of such nested *vagga* structures include the Saṁyutta Nikāya and the Khandhakas of the Pali Vinaya.

### Paṇṇāsa (“Fifty”)

The word <i>paṇṇāsa</i> means “fifty”, and it is a group of approximately fifty suttas, or five vaggas. It is used to organize collections that contain many vaggas. The <i>paṇṇāsa</i> is purely for convenience, and does not correspond to any meaningful divisions of the text.

### Nipāta (“Group”)

The literal meaning of <i>nipāta</i> is “fallen down”, and it is a generic term for texts that have been placed together. In the Aṅguttara, it is used for each division of texts gathered together by number: the groups of discourses consisting of one item, and so on. Elsewhere it is used, for example, in the title of the Sutta Nipāta, the “Group of Discourses”.

### Saṁyutta (“Collection of Linked Discourses”)

Whereas *nipāta* is quite generic, the *saṃyutta* has a more specific meaning: texts collected according to a similar theme or subject matter. The Saṁyutta Nikāya consists of 52 such collections.

### Nikāya or Āgama (“Division”)

The largest structural unit, usually known as *nikāya* in the Pali tradition of the Theravāda, and as *āgama* in the northern traditions. However, the term *āgama*, while it has fallen into disuse in modern Theravāda, is found quite commonly in the Pali commentaries.

The four *nikāyas* as found in the Pali seem to have been fairly standard and similar collections are, so far as we know, found in all the other schools. However, while the overall nature of the collections is similar, and they are organized in similar ways, the detailed content varies considerably. It frequently happens that a sutta found in the Majjhima of one school, for example, may be found in the Saṁyutta or Dīgha of another school. In addition, the internal sequence of texts is quite different. It seems the *nikāyas* were conceived more as organizational guidelines than as fixed units.

The fifth Pali *nikāya*, the Khuddaka Nikāya, is more flexible and varies more between traditions. It seems it originated as a place for collecting verses and minor texts not gathered elsewhere. However the Pali collection became a handy place to include later texts. While there are occasional references to a similar collection in the northern schools, none exist in that form today. Nevertheless, many of the individual texts of the Khuddaka have parallels, with the Dhammapada especially existing in many dfferent editions.
