1. HE with the long loose locks supports Agni, and moisture, heaven, and earth:
He is all sky to look upon: he with long hair is called this light.
2 The Munis, girdled with the wind, wear garments soiled of yellow hue.
They, following the wind's swift course go where the Gods have gone before.
3 Transported with our Munihood we have pressed on into the winds:
You therefore, mortal men. behold our natural bodies and no more.
4 The Muni, made associate in the holy work of every God,
Looking upon all varied forms flies through the region of the air.
5 The Steed of Vāta, Vāyu's friend, the Muni, by the Gods impelled,
In both the oceans hath his home, in eastern and in western sea.
6 Treading the path of sylvan beasts, Gandharvas, and Apsarases,
He with long locks, who knows the wish, is a sweet most delightful friend
7 Vāyu hath churned for him: for him he poundeth things most hard to bend,
When he with long loose locks hath drunk, with Rudra, water from the cup.

Cattāro ca paṭipannā
8261: Cattāro ca phale ṭhitā
8262: Esa saṅgho ujubhuto
8263  Paññāsīlasamāhito.

yadidam cattari was probably taken from the aggapasada sutta:

āvatā bhikkhave saṅghā vā gaṇā vā, tathāgatasāvakasaṅgho tesaṃ aggamakkhāyati. Yadidaṃ cattāri purisayugāni aṭṭhapurisapuggalā esa bhagavato sāvakasaṅgho āhuneyyo pāhuṇeyyo dakkhiṇeyyo añjalikaraṇīyo anuttaraṃ puññakkhettaṃ lokassa.

The yadidam is missing from Chinese parallels, eg. EA 21.1:

What does taking refuge of one’s own accord in the Saṃgha of Noble Ones mean? As for that which is referred to as the Community of Noble Ones, among all forms of monastic communities and all kinds of assemblies in society, the Tathāgata’s Saṃgha is superior, foremost and without equal

But at EA 21.4:

Similarly, they should be encouraged to contemplate and honour this Order of Disciples, the Tathāgata’s Śrāvakasaṃgha, thus: Among them prevails absolute concord, they walk in the right path, are endowed with all virtues and have achieved perfection in moral training, concentration and wisdom, in ultimate freedom and insight-knowledge of this freedom, that is to say the Order of Disciples, the four pairs of noble persons and the eight kinds of āryas. This is the Tathāgata’s Śrāvakasaṃgha, worthy of respect and worthy of veneration, this is the world’s incomparable field of merit.

making merit that results in attachments,
Karotaṃ opadhikaṃ puññaṃ,
? making merit with attachments


The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, straightforward, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a teacher’s offering, and worthy of greeting with joined palms; it is the supreme field of merit for the world.
