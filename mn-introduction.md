# A Reader’s Introduction to the Middle Discourses

The Majjhima Nikāya is the second of the four main divisions in the Sutta Piṭaka of the Pali Canon (*tipiṭaka*). It is translated here as <cite>Middle Discourses</cite>, and is sometimes known as the <cite>Middle-Length Discourses</cite>. As the title suggests, its discourses are somewhat shorter than those of the Dīgha Nikāya (<cite>Long Discourses</cite>), but longer than the many short discourses collected in the Saṁyutta Nikāya (<cite>Linked Discourses</cite>) and Aṅguttara Nikāya (<cite>Numbered Discourses</cite>).

In the classic introduction to his translation of the Majjhima Nikāya—an introduction that inspired the current essay—Bhikkhu Bodhi described the Majjhima as “the collection that combines the richest variety of contextual settings with the deepest and most comprehensive assortment of teachings”. He went on to situate it among the other *nikāyas*:

>Like the Dīgha Nikāya, the Majjhima is replete with drama and narrative, while lacking much of its predecessor’s tendency towards imaginative embellishment and profusion of legend. Like the Saṁyutta, it contains some of the profoundest discourses in the Canon, disclosing the Buddha’s radical insights into the nature of existence; and like the Aṅguttara, it covers a wide range of topics of practical applicability. In contrast to those two Nikāyas, however, the Majjhima sets forth this material not in the form of short, self-contained utterances, but in the context of a fascinating procession of scenarios that exhibit the Buddha’s resplendence of wisdom, his skill in adapting his teachings to the needs and proclivities of his interlocutors, his wit and gentle humour, his majestic sublimity, and his compassionate humanity.

In this short introductory essay, I describe some of the special features of the Majjhima.

## How the Majjhima is Organized

There are 152 discourses collected in the  Majjhima. These are collected into groups of 50 discourses (*paṇṇāsa*), although the final *paṇṇāsa* contains 52.

Within each *paṇṇāsa* is a set of five *vaggas*. As usual, most of the *vaggas* are simply named after their first sutta, but a few exhibit some thematic unity:

- **Opamma Vagga (Chapter With Similes):** All these discourses prominently feature similes.
- **Mahāyamaka Vagga (Large Chapter With Pairs):** Paired “long” and “short” discourses. (The following Short Chapter With Pairs only has two sets of pairs.)
- **Vaggas 6–10:** These collect discourses featuring certain kinds of people: householders, mendicants, wanderers, kings, and brahmins.
- **Vibhaṅga Vagga (Chapter on Analysis):** These discourses consist of a lengthy “analysis” of a short saying.
- **Saḷāyatana Vagga (Chapter on the Six Senses):** These focus on the six senses.

## The Audience

In the Majjhima Nikāya we commonly see the Buddha teaching his monastic disciples. This itself can be quite diverse, as the community was comprised of men and women from all walks of life, and at varying levels of spiritual achievement.

However the monastics are far from the only people we meet. In his wide wanderings across the Ganges plain, the Buddha interacted with a wide cross-section of the local peoples: learned brahmins and simple villagers; kings and slaves; priests and prostitutes; women and men; children and the elderly; the devout and the skeptical; the sick and the disabled; those seeking to disparage and those sincerely seeking the truth.

## Imagery and Narrative

The Majjhima includes an astonishing range of similes and imagery, found in almost all discourses. Sometimes these are extended to short parables. MN 21 <cite>The Simile of the Saw</cite> tells the memorable story of the bold maid Kāḷī who tested her mistress. In MN 56.27 <cite>With Upāli</cite> we meet the brahmin lady who wanted to not only dye her pet monkey, but press and wring him out.

While the Buddha himself speaks only short tales, in the background narratives we find more developed narratives, including famous stories as the taming of the vicious serial-killer Aṅgulimāla (MN 86) or the uncompromising commitment of the wealthy youth Raṭṭhapāla (MN 82), who defied his parents will to take ordination, and whose discourse finishes with an extraordinary set of teachings for his king.

Some stories are less earth-bound. MN 37 <cite>The Shorter Discourse on the Ending of Craving</cite> depicts Moggallāna ascending to the heaven of Sakka the lord of gods to check his indulgence. MN 50 <cite>The Rebuke of Māra</cite> also features Moggallāna, ths time in a dialogue with Māra, the lord of deceit and death; and it contains the startling revelation that Moggallāna himself was Māra in a past life. Such cosmic drama reaches its apex in MN 49 <cite>On the Invitation of Brahmā</cite>, where the Buddha takes on no less that Brahmā himself in a high-level philosophical debate, forcing Māra to reveal himself on the side of Brahmā. From the perspective of early Buddhism, God and the Devil are not so very different.

## The Buddha in the Majjhima

The Majjhima Nikāya furnishes us with many of the most crucial and beloved tales of the Buddha’s life. Episodes from these texts form a primary source of knowledge for the Buddha’s early life and teaching career. While the tendency towards legend-building is apparent in some places, most of these episodes are simple and realistic.

In MN 123 <cite>Incredible and Amazing</cite> we find Ānanda, the founder of Buddhist biography, recounting an extended series of apparently miraculous events that accompanied the birth of the Buddha-to-be. Whether regarded as history or legend, this text, with its devotional tone and emphasis on the extraordinary, shows a shift in emphasis towards honoring the person of the Buddha; a shift that the Buddha resists by pointing out that the truly extraordinary thing is to be aware of one’s own mind.

It is in the Majjhima (MN 36, MN 85, MN 100) that the Buddha speaks of that crucial moment in his childhood where he spontaneously entered the first absorption, a state of profound peace and stillness in meditation. Much later, when he arrived at a crisis in his spiritual progress, he was to recall this event and realize that such peace was the only true path to awakening (*eso’va maggo bodhāya*).

In MN 75.10 <cite>With Māgaṇḍiya</cite> the Buddha recounts the luxuries he enjoyed as a young man, and in MN 26.13 tells of how he left home though his parents wept. There follows the story of the six years of striving, divided into three periods. It seems that first he practiced under a yogic tradition, probably following the Upanishadic philosophy. MN 26 tells of his experience under the famed spiritual guides Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta. Despite the elevated meditative attainments he reached under their tutelage, he was still unsatisfied, so he left to embark on a more severe ascetic path.

According to the traditions, the bulk of the six years was spent enduring harsh austerities, practices that are similar or identical to those observed by the Jains. These are described in detail in MN 12 <cite>The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar</cite> and MN 36 <cite>The Longer Discourse With Saccaka</cite>. But after many years of such self-mortification he was getting nowhere. So he took some solid food and, recalling his childhood experience of absorption, began the third and final phase of his practice, which lead directly to his awakening.

While it might seem as if the night of awakening followed directly from his rejection of austerities, several discourses in the Majjhima indicate that this period involved a rather extensive development of meditation. MN 19 <cite>Two Kinds of Thought</cite>, for example, tells of his analysis and training in wholesome thought; MN 4 <cite>Fear and Terror</cite> depicts his struggles to overcome fear; and MN 128 <cite>Corruptions</cite> speaks of a series of specific meditative hindrances he encountered.

The Majjhima makes no mention of the Buddha’s wife, although his son Rāhula is prominently featured in several discourses (MN 61, MN 62, MN 147), showing the Buddha’s patient teaching and Rāhula’s eventual awakening. The Buddha’s father is briefly mentioned in the above passage on meditation as a child, but his birth mother, Māyā, is not mentioned in the Majjhima at all. His stepmother Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, however, appears in MN 142 <cite>The Analysis of Offerings to the Teacher</cite>, where she offers robes to her son; but he encourages her to offer them rather to the whole community.

MN 91 <cite>With Brahmāyu</cite> describes his behavior in minute detail, recording the tiny nuances of mindfulness and care that he brought to every activity. His followers saw him as the embodiment of the highest truth. Discerning his realization in every detail of his words and acts, they could be moved to exalted praise (MN 92 <cite>With Sela</cite>). However, far from encouraging mindless devotion, the Buddha encouraged his students to investigate him, describing a rigorous and detailed set of tests that a good spiritual teacher should pass (MN 47 <cite>The Inquirer</cite>).

## The Disciples

Although we think of the suttas as “teachings of the Buddha”, in fact only about a quarter of the discourses in the Majjhima feature the Buddha simply delivering a discourse to the assembly. Over half the discourses consist of dialogues (*vyākaraṇa*). Sometimes the Buddha asks a question and leads the assembly through a process of Socratic inquiry. Sometimes a seeker asks a question or a series of questions. The Buddha may answer in various ways—sometimes directly, sometimes with a counter-question, sometimes with a lengthy analysis—depending on the nature of the question and the questioner. And intriguingly, he sometimes doesn’t answer at all.

And as well as featuring in one way or another in most of the discourses, various disciples serve as primary teachers in about a fifth of the discourses of the Majjhima, continuing the Buddha’s work of exploring and explaining the teachings. In the Majjhima Nikāya we meet a range of skilled and accomplished teachers, many of whom became widely-famed in the Buddhist traditions. From the beginning of his dispensation, the Buddha was eager to empower his followers, encouraging them to share the teaching to the best of their ability.

Nine discourses are spoken by the Buddha’s chief disciple and renowned General of the Dhamma, Sāriputta. These include MN 9, a wide-ranging exploration of the many facets of right view; MN 28, which shows how all the teachings can be included in the four noble truths; and MN 141, giving a fully detailed explanation of the four noble truths based on the Buddha’s first sermon. In these discourses Sāriputta shows his interest in developing a systematic overview of the Dhamma. Such analyses are one of the primary inspirations behind the later development of the Abhidhamma texts, and Sāriputta is rightly regarded as one of the fathers of the Abhidhamma.

Mahākaccāna is another monk of renowned wisdom, whose incisive analytic style, with especial focus on the process of sense experience, influenced the Abhidhamma. He spoke four discourses in the Majjhima. MN 28, the “Honey Cake” demonstrates his unmatched skill in drawing out subtle implications of brief teachings by the Buddha. This discourse received a detailed treatment in Katukurunde Nyanananda’s <cite>Concept and Reality in Early Buddhist Thought</cite>, one of the most influential monographs in modern Buddhist studies.

MN 24, a dialogue between Sāriputta and Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta, speaks of a relay of chariots, introducing the idea of the seven stages of purification that was to greatly influence the concept of stages of insight in Buddhaghosa’s <cite>Visuddhimagga</cite> and contemporary Theravada meditation.

The nun Dhammadinnā presents the only discourse by a *bhikkhunī* in the Majjhima. It seems that the teachings by women in the suttas, while rare, were included because of their unique and striking wisdom. In MN 44 she responds to a series of questions by her former husband, revealing her depth of meditative accomplishment and wisdom.

Further discourses by disciples include several by Moggallāna, Anuruddha, and others. And we cannot pass a discussion on disciples without mentioning Ānanda, who lived closest to the Buddha, and through whom, according to tradition, all the texts passed. Ānanda is the main teacher in seven discourses, and features in many more. Ānanda has a specially close interest in the personal life of the Buddha, and it is with him that the Buddha’s life story began to take on its familiar form.

## A Brief and Incomplete Textual History

The Majjhima Nikāya was edited by V. Trenckner (vol. 1) and Robert Chalmers (vols. 2 and 3) on the basis of manuscripts in Sinhalese, Burmese, and Thai scripts, and published in Latin script by the Pali Text Society from 1888 to 1899. The first translation followed in 1926–7 by Robert Chalmers under the title <cite>Further Dialogues of the Buddha</cite>.

Rapid improvements in understanding of Pali and Buddhism during the early 20th century soon made it clear that an improved translation was needed. This was undertaken in the 1950s by I.B. Horner, and was published by the PTS as <cite>The Book of Middle Length Sayings</cite> in 1954–9.

Her translation, while a significant improvement on Chalmers’, was soon eclipsed by that of Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoḷi. Ñāṇamoḷi’s extraordinary career as a Pali scholar and translator was tragically cut short by his early death, and his Majjhima Nikāya translation remained as an unfinished hand-written manuscript. Nevertheless, its value was so clear that it was published, first as a selection of 90 discourses edited by Bhikkhu Khantipalo and published in Bangkoko in 1976 as <cite>A Treasury of the Buddha’s Word</cite>, then as a fully edited and updated version by Bhikkhu Bodhi in 1995 under the title <cite>The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Majjhima Nikaya</cite>. The latter version reached a peak of accuracy, consistency, and readability that has become the standard to which all later translations of the *nikāyas* have aspired.

When the Pali was unclear I frequently referred to the earlier work of Ñāṇamoḷi & Bodhi, and less often to Horner and various translations of specific texts. I also had access to notes by Bhikkhus Ñāṇadīpa and Ñāṇatusita on Bhikkhu Bodhi’s translation. In addition, I consulted the Chinese and other parallel texts, and the detailed studies on these by Bhikkhu Anālayo. However, I found these to be useful for translation in only a few cases, as I believe it is important to preserve the integrity of the different textual lineages. Comparative studies lose value when the underlying texts have already been reconciled.

Translations of the Majjhima are equally popular in languages apart from English. SuttaCentral currently hosts translations of all or part of the Majjhima in about thirty languages. We aim to expand and improve coverage so that people of the world can enjoy these teachings in their own language.
