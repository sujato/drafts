# Notes on notes

In our source files for the Mahasangiti edition, we found the folder `studies.worldtipitaka.org_all_note`, which contained 806 HTML files. These contain what appear to be the complete text-critical apparatus of the Mahasangiti edition, under the title “Nānāpāṭha (Variant Readings & Reference Vols. 1 - 40)”.

The data is, unfortunately, is not in raw form, but is embedded in the HTML scraped from the MS website. This was used by Blake and Vimala as the basis for the variant readings and cross-references found on SuttaCentral.

Here I have extracted the raw data in table form. Each table row contains:

1. The `ms` reference number.
2. The type of note, of which there are four.
    1. Variant readings.
    2. Cross references
    3. Beginning Notes
    4. Ending notes.
3. The text as found in the MS edition, together with an ⁕ indicating the exact position of the note. (Currently changed from `*` so as to avoid confusing markdown.)
4. The note content.
