# The Discourse Collection: asceticism, experience, and devotion

The Sutta Nipāta is the fifth book of the Khuddaka Nikāya of the Pali canon. It is mainly verse, with a few prose sections.

The text is, so far as we know, unique to the Pali tradition. There are no parallels to the book as a whole in the Tibetan or Chinese canons, nor any references to it in the northern traditions. There are, however, many parallels to specific verses or sections of the text; among others, the Ratana Sutta, Khaggavisāṇa Sutta, and Aṭṭhakavagga have important parallels. Several of the texts, such as the Sela Sutta, are found elsewhere in the Pali canon. And, as always, individual verses are widely shared across the many verse collections found in all schools of Buddhism.

The Sutta Nipāta has a unique structure, in that it is comprised (almost) entirely of *poems*, that is, coherent sets of verses. Often Buddhist verse collections consist of assemblages of individual verses loosely connected by theme (Dhammapada), or verses associated with a prose background story (Udāna, Jātaka). Perhaps the closest literary cousin of the Sutta Nipāta would be the Sagāthā Vagga of the Saṁyutta Nikāya, which likewise consists of various sets of verses, often in dialogue form, and with a minimal narrative background. Several of the Sutta Nipāta texts are in fact shared with the Sagāthā Vagga, such as the Kasi-Bhāradvāja Sutta (Snp 1.4).

The poems of the Sutta Nipāta are, like all early Buddhist texts, organized in *vaggas*, that is, chapters of roughly ten texts; although, unusually, all the chapters of the Sutta Nipāta consist of more than ten texts. The first three chapters have only slender thematic connections.

However the final two chapters are fairly tightly knit, and evidently were self-contained collections that were added to the Sutta Nipāta. They are referred to by name in several places in the prose Suttas, and the Aṭṭhakavagga has a version in the Chinese canon. These chapters, together with certain other texts such as the Khaggavisāṇa Sutta, show certain signs of being old texts, such as archaic vocabulary and metrical forms.

This has led to the oft-repeated claim that the Sutta Nipāta is a uniquely early text. It is not. Many of the poems in the Sutta Nipāta are not especially early, and some of them are quite late, notably the opening verses of the Nālaka Sutta (Snp 3.11). Even in the cases of the early verses, there is no compelling reason to consider them as any earlier than the bulk of the prose discourses. These sections are, moreover, comprised of elements of differing periods; the Introduction to the Pārāyana Vagga, for example, is later than the questions that follow it.

One detail that may be confusing. The Sutta Nipāta in this book is referenced in two ways: either by chapter and Sutta (eg. Snp 1.1), or by verse number (Snp 11). If the reference contains a period, look for the chapter and Sutta, if there is no period, look for the verse number.

## Themes

Since the collection is primarily organized by literary style rather than topic, it contains texts on a wide variety of themes. These themes are familiar elsewhere in Buddhist texts, and I will briefly summarize them here.

- The virtues of renunciation and the proper life of the ascetic (eg. Snp 1.1, Snp 1.3)
- Ethical virtues and dangers (eg. Snp 1.6, Snp 1.7)
- Revaluation of contemporary, often Brahmanical, views (eg. Snp 1.4, Snp 2.7)
- Conversion of native deities (eg. Snp 1.9, Snp 1.10)
- The virtues of the Buddha and Triple Gem (eg. Snp 2.1, Snp 3.7)
- Biography (eg. Snp 3.1, Snp 3.2, Snp 3.10, Snp 3.11, Snp 4.15)
- Meditation and mental development (eg. Snp 1.8, Snp 1.11, Snp 2.10)
- Philosophy, especially of causation and not-self (eg. Snp 3.12, Snp 4.11)
- Letting go of disputatious views (eg. Snp 4.3, Snp 4.12, Snp 4.13)

I would add a word of caution against over-interpreting the text. Perhaps the most striking themes, sometimes taken as emblematic of the collection as a whole, are the first and last in the above list: the virtues of renunciation, and the dangers of disputatious views. If one assumes that the Sutta Nipāta is a uniquely archaic text, it is tempting to see these positions as more authentic to the Buddha’s original teachings than what is found in the bulk of the prose texts. I don’t think this is the case. The virtue of renunciation and a simple wandering life is mentioned in many places in the prose Suttas, as is the danger of getting involved in disputations based on theoretical views. Perhaps they are emphasized more in the Sutta Nipāta, but this is hardly a sign of any substantially different doctrine. It is, in my view, a mistake to develop a theory of Early Buddhism based on a few verses.

There is no overall thematic development in the text, so the reader can start wherever they like. The only exception is the final chapter, which is one long Sutta and should be read as a whole.

The Sutta Nipāta is most usefully read as a guide and an inspiration. The texts are vivid, personal, and direct. There is little of the flowery adornment that characterized later Buddhist literature. And the verse form leaves out much of the repetition that can seem so ponderous in the prose texts. The texts are highly concentrated; a little has a lot of flavor.

In my first rains retreat as a monk, I read just the Sutta Nipāta, one discourse each day, while I memorized most of the Pali text. It was an endless source of inspiration and wisdom for me, and I hope it can be so for you as well.
