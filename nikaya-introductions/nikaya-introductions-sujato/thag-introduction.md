# The Verses of the Senior Monks & Nuns: the struggles and joys of the contemplative life

The Theragāthā and Therīgāthā are classic Pali collections of verses by early Buddhist monks and nuns. The works consists of 1289 verses by monks and 524 verses by nuns, collected according to the monk or nun with whom they were traditionally associated. These poems speak from the personal experience of mendicants living in or near the time of the Buddha. More than any other text we find here a range of voices expressing the fears, inspirations, struggles, and triumphs of the spiritual search.

Most of the verses in the Theragāthā are straightforward and didactic. Though formally cast as verse, their concern is not primarily with poetic style, but with meaning. They employed their literary forms solely in order to create an understanding in the listener, an understanding that leads to the letting go of suffering.

## Our translation

In 2013 I was approached by Jessica Walton (then Ayyā Nibbidā), a student of mine, who wanted a project to help learn Pali. I suggested that she work on the Thera/Therī-gāthā, in the hope that we could create a freely available translation.

Of course, this is a terrible job for a student—these are some of the most difficult texts in the Pali canon. But I hoped that it would prove useful, and so it has. I suggested that Jessica use Norman’s translation side by side with the Pali and work on creating a more readable rendering. She did this, mostly working on her own.

When she was happy with that, she passed the project over to me, and when I got the chance I took it up. I then went over the text in detail, modifying virtually every one of Jessica’s lines, while still keeping many of her turns of phrase. Without her work, this translation would not have been completed.

I also referred heavily to Norman’s translation, which enabled me to make sense of the many obscurities of vocabulary and syntax found in the text. Only rarely have I departed from Norman’s linguistic interpretations, and I have adopted his renderings on occasions when I felt I couldn’t do better.

There are, however, many occasions when Norman’s work is limited by his purely linguistic approach. There is no better example of this than Thag 411. The Pali begins _uṭṭhehi nisīda_, on which Norman notes:

> The collocation of “stand up” and “sit down” is strange and clearly one or other of the words is used metaphorically.

He then renders the verse thus:

> Stand up, Kātiyāna, pay attention; do not be full of sleep, be awake. May the kinsman of the indolent, king death, not conquer lazy you, as though with a snare.

But to any meditator there is nothing strange about this at all; it just means to get up and meditate. I render the verse:

> Get up, Kātiyāna, and sit!<br>
Don’t sleep too much, be wakeful.<br>
Don’t be lazy, and let the kinsman of the heedless,<br>
The king of death, catch you in his trap.

## About the Theragāthā and Therīgāthā

What follows is a brief and non-technical introduction. If you are interested in a more detailed technical analysis, you can read Norman’s long introductions to his translations, which specially focus on the metrical styles.

Each of the verses of the Theragāthā and Therīgāthā is collected under the name of a certain monk or nun. In many cases the verses were attributed to these mendicants. I see no reason why the bulk of the verses should not be authentic. However, not all the verses can be ascribed to the mendicants in question. Sometimes the verses are in a dialogue form; or they may be teaching verses addressed to a mendicant; or they may be verses about a mendicant; and in some cases they have been added by later redactors. In many cases, the verses are in a vague third person, which leaves it ambiguous whether it was meant to be by the mendicant or about them. Sometimes, also, verses are repeated, both within the Theragāthā and in other Buddhist texts, so a speaker of a verse is not always its composer. It is best, then, to consider the collection as “Verses associated with the senior monks and nuns”.

I have used the terms “senior monk” and "senior nun" rather than “elder” to render _thera_ and _therī_. This is because not all the mendicants here are “elders” in the sense of being wizened old men or women. Usually a _thera_ is simply one who has completed 10 years as since ordination, so a nun of thirty years of age, while hardly an “elder”, may be a _therī_.

As well as being collected according to the name of the associated mendicant, the texts are organized by number (the _aṅguttara_ principle). That is, the first sets of verses are those where a mendicant is associated with only one verse; then two, three, and so on. There is, in addition, an occasional connection of subject matter or literary style from one verse to the other; and, rarely, a thin narrative context (eg. Thag 16.1).

The numbering of the collections needs a little attention. The texts may be referenced by three means, all of which are available on SuttaCentral; either by simple verse count, or by chapter and verse, or by the page number of the PTS Pali edition.

The primary system used in SuttaCentral is the chapter and verse, as this collects all the verses associated with a given monk in one place. This chapter and verse system is not used in the PTS editions, but it is used in the Mahāsaṅgīti text on which the translation is based. However this system can be a little confusing—or at least, I was confused by it! From the ones to the fourteens there is no problem. However, there is no set of fifteen verses, so we skip from the fourteens to the sixteens. Here the numbering of the sections goes out of alignment with the number of verses: the fifteenth section (Thag 15.1) consists of a set of sixteen verses. The sixteenth section (Thag 16.1 etc.) then consists of sets of twenty or more verses, and so on.

In terms of dating, the Theragāthā belongs firmly to the corpus of early Buddhist texts. Most of the monks are said to have lived in the time of the Buddha, and there seems no good reason to doubt this. In a minority of cases, due to the content of the text, the vocabulary or metre, or the statements in the commentary, the verses appear to date from as late as the time of king Ashoka. Norman suggests a period of composition of almost 300 years; however, if we adopt, as it seems we should, the “median chronology” that places the death of the Buddha not long before 400 BCE, then the period of composition would be closer to 200 years.

All Pali canonical texts have been transmitted to us alongside a commentary. The commentary to the Theragāthā and Therīgāthā, called the Paramatthadīpanī, was written by Dhammapāla approximately 1,000 years after the text itself. As well as providing the normal kinds of linguistic and doctrinal analysis, the commentary gives background stories for the lives of the monks, many of whom we know little about apart from the Theragāthā itself. In some cases, the stories provide context to make sense of the verses, and there seems little doubt that these verses, as is the normal way in Pali, were passed down from the earliest times with some form of narrative context and explanation. Like the Jātakas, the Dhammapada, or the Udāna, the verses formed the emotional and doctrinal kernel of the story. However, in the form that we have it today, the commentary clearly speaks to a set of concerns and ideas that date long after the Theragāthā itself. While the commentary is invaluable in understanding what the meaning of these texts was for the Theravadin tradition, it is probably in only rare cases that it provides genuine historical information about the people involved. I have consulted the commentary only in cases where the meaning of the verse was unclear to me.

What is striking to me is just how clear-cut the demarcation of Pali texts really is. The Theragāthā sits firmly on the far side of a dividing line in Pali literature that stems from the time of King Aśoka or thereabouts, about 150 years after the Buddha. It is concerned with seclusion, meditation, mindfulness, and above all, liberation. Later texts were concerned with glorifying the Buddha, and especially with encouraging acts of merit for attaining heaven or enlightenment in future lives. Such is the substance of the Thera- and Therī- Apadānas, which are a later addition, somewhat modeled after the Theragāthā and Therīgāthā, but telling fantastic stories of merit-making in past lives.

Such concerns are notable for their absence from the Theragāthā; when they are present, such as Sela’s verses extolling the Buddha, they remain grounded in human experience, rather than the elaborate fantasies of later days. There is a single exception to this, Thag 1.96 Khaṇḍasumana, which says, in very Apadāna-like style, how after offering a flower he rejoiced in heaven for 800 million years, and then attained extinguishment due to the power of the remaining merit. But this just feels so out of place. Among the countless verses that speak of retreating to solitude, of devotion to meditation, of renouncing everything in the world, such sentiments seem as if from a different world of thought; a different religion even.

The classical Theragāthā verse is a song of liberation, rejoicing in a simple life lived with nature. Here’s a typical example, from Thag 1.22, the verse of Cittaka:

> Crested peacocks with beautiful blue necks<br>
Cry out in Karaṃvī.<br>
Aroused by a cool breeze,<br>
They awaken the sleeper to practice absorption.

But the verses embrace a wide range of subjects; straightforward doctrinal statements, lamentations of the decline of the Sangha, eulogy of great mendicants, or simple narrative.

While the texts are mostly direct and clear-hearted, some of the most interesting verses are those that speak from the mind’s contradictions, the longings that accompany a full-blooded commitment to the spiritual life. Nowhere has this very human ambiguity been expressed better than in the extended set of verses by Tālapuṭa (Thag 19.1). Employing an unusually sophisticated poetic style—only exceeded in this regard by Vaṅgīsa, in whose verses we can discern the beginnings of the decadent poetics of later generations—and addressing his recalcitrant mind in an unusual second person, he berates it for its inconstancy:

> Oh, when will the winter clouds rain freshly<br>
As I wear my robe in the forest,<br>
Walking the path trodden by the sages?<br>
When will it be? …

> For many years you begged me,<br>
“Enough of living in a house for you!”<br>
Why do you not urge me on, mind,<br>
Now I’ve gone forth as an ascetic?

## The Verses of the Nuns

The collection opens at Thig 1.1 with one of its most distinctive images. An unnamed nun is addressed, or addresses herself:

> Sleep softly, little nun,<br>
> wrapped in the cloth you sewed yourself;<br>
> for your desire has been quelled,<br>
> like vegetables boiled dry in a pot.

The charming, domestic imagery is quite absent from verses by the monks. Just as the masculine imagery of a warrior, a thoroughbred stallion, or a conquering king was repurposed to serve the Dhamma, here the nun creatively reflects on her experience in a kitchen. Boiling the vegetables dry is, from a worldly perspective, a bad thing, as they are no longer juicy and delectable. But there is something still about that state: dried up, they last. Desire is, as here, frequently figured as a moisture or sap, and with its drying it leaves the nun at peace. In this way the most common of sights takes on a layered and rather subversive meaning.

One should not think that all, or even most, of the Therīgāthā verses have such a characteristically feminine slant. Many of them present straight Dhamma teachings indistinguishable from, and often enough actually shared with, the verses of the monks. But it is the distinctive verses that attract the most attention.

Perhaps the most famous of all is the verse of Muttā in Thig 1.11. This echo the verse of the monk Sumaṅgala at Thag 1.43, which speaks of the drudgery of the "crooked" tools he used as a farmer: sickles, plows, and hoes. Muttā’s sly reworking suggests that sexual chores were as much a part of a woman’s life as domestic drudgery.

> I’m well freed, so very well freed;<br>
> freed from the three things that bent me over:<br>
> the mortar, the pestle,<br>
> and my humpbacked husband.

Of all the texts in the Pali canon, it is in the verses of these senior monks and nuns that we come closest to the personal experience of living in the time of the Buddha, struggling with, and eventually overcoming, the causes of suffering that are so captivating. I hope that this new translation can help bring these experiences to life for a new audience.

## A Brief Textual History

The Theragāthā has been fully translated into English twice before, both times published by the Pali Text Society. The first translation was by Caroline A.F. Rhys Davids in 1913 as <cite>Psalms of the Brethren</cite>, reprinted in <cite>Psalms of the Early Buddhists</cite>. The second was by K.R. Norman in 1969 as <cite>Elders’ Verses I</cite>. The efforts of the former translators is utterly indispensable, and their work makes each succeeding attempt that much easier. Nevertheless, the limitations of these earlier translations are well known. The Rhys Davids translation employs highly archaic language and poetic styles, as well as being based on a dated sensibility regarding both Pali and Buddhism. Norman’s translation, while exemplary in terms of Indological linguistics, employs what Norman himself described as “a starkness and austerity of words which borders on the ungrammatical”. But in addition to the translation, his edition includes an extremely extensive set of linguistic notes, which are invaluable for parsing out the obscurities of the verses.

Both of the earlier translations were based on the Pali Text Society’s edition by Hermann Oldenberg and Richard Pischel of 1883. The current translation, by contrast, is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali canon, as published on SuttaCentral. It numbers 1289 verses as opposed to the 1279 of the PTS editions. The extra verses arise, not from a difference in substance, but from the inclusion of repetitions that were absent from the PTS editions. The first set of extra verses is at verse 1020 and the second at verse 1161. Up to verse 1020, therefore, the numbering is the same in the SuttaCentral and PTS editions.

The Therīgāthā has been translated more often than the Theragāthā, reflecting its unique position as a work devoted to early Buddhist women’s voices. Caroline A.F. Rhys Davids was the pioneer, translating it in 1909 for the Pali Text Society under the title <cite>Psalms of the Sisters</cite>. K.R. Norman also created a companion to his Theragāthā translation under the title <cite>Elders’ Verses II</cite>.

Susan Murcott made a free translation, or rather reinterpretation, in her <cite>The First Buddhist Women: Translations and Commentaries on the Therigatha</cite>, published with Parallax Press in 1991. Charles Hallisey followed with his <cite>Therigatha: Poems of the First Buddhist Women</cite>, published with the Murty Classical Library of India, Harvard University Press in 2015. Finally, Anagarika Mahendra made a more literal and traditional translation through Dhamma Publishers in 2017 under the title <cite>Verses of the Elder Bhikkhunis</cite>.

The Therīgāthā is also one of the few Pali works for which the commentary has been translated. This was by William Pruitt for the Pali Text Society in 1998 under the title <cite>Commentary on the Verses of the Therīs: Therīgāthā-aṭṭhakathā: Paramatthadīpanī VI</cite>.

Various partial translations have also been made. While my work primarily leans on that of Norman, I have consulted translations by Bhikkhu Bodhi and Bhikkhu Thanissaro for a few verses. I have, however, not consulted the Rhys Davids translations at all.
