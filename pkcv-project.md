# Parakramabāhu II Cullavagga Transcription project

## Introduction

In the National Museum of Colombo there rests one of the oldest, and arguably most important, Pali manuscripts found anywhere in the world. It contains the Cullavagga, which consists of chapters 11–22 of the *Khandhaka* portion of the Pali Vinaya.

The texts of the Pali Tipiṭaka are our most important witness for the original teachings and person of the Buddha. Their significance has always been recognized in Theravada Buddhism, and became known internationally in the 19th century through the work of scholars such as [T.W. Rhys Davids](http://0-www.worldcat.org.novacat.nova.edu/identities/lccn-n50035648/) in England, or [Bunyiu Nanjio](http://0-www.worldcat.org.novacat.nova.edu/identities/lccn-n81033028/) in Japan.

Pali texts were traditionally passed down on palm (or *ola*) leaf manuscripts. From the late 19th century into the 20th century these manuscripts have been transcribed and published in book form. From the 1990s the books have been digitized, and are now widely available in several editions on the internet. All this has greatly increased the availability of the Pali texts and has benefited scholars immensely.

However, in recent years scholars have paid greater attention to the problem of manuscript authenticity. Almost all of the manuscripts in existence date from the 18th and 19th centuries. This means that the entire Pali tradition rests on physical witnesses no more than a couple of centuries old. Linguistic, historical, and other evidence gives us good reason to be confident that the Pali texts are, on the whole, much older than this, and that they substantially date back to the time of the Buddha or shortly after. {See *The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts*, Sujato and Brahmali.} Nevertheless, we should not neglect the opportunity to further test and refine our understanding of the historical provenance of the Pali texts.

One project that contributed to this was the article by Oskar von Hinuber, *The Earliest Buddhist Manuscript*. This offers a transcription, description, and detailed study of a 8th–9th century Pali manuscript from Nepal by a leading Pali philologist. As it happens, the text itself, while only a few pages, is from the Cullavagga. Thus is a small portion of the same text found in the
