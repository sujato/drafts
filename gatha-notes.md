# Notes on the Theragatha, etc.

1. It seems that when the `<h1>` heading includes a variant span, the trailing period is lost. Compare:
 - `<span class="var" title="bellaṭṭhisīsattheragāthā (bj)" id="note14">1.16 Belaṭṭhasīsattheragāthā</span>`
 - `1.17. Dāsakattheragāthā`
2. The ascription of the verses at the end of each set is usually abbreviated, and the ellipses are clumsily assigned their own segment, eg. [here](https://pootle.suttacentral.net/en/kn/translate/thag/thag01.016.po#unit=183365). Better to include such segments in the following.
3. span class="gathaquote" --> speaker
4. Bhaddiya son of Godhā practices absorption without grasping. --> fix segments.
5. Thig has only sutta, not nipata numbers in H1 headings, this should be corrected to be consistent with Thag. This is in the Pali.
